@article{Oyama2023-oj,
	abstract = {Although glass phases are ubiquitously found in various soft
               matter systems, we are still far from a complete understanding of
               them. The concept of marginal stability predicted by
               infinite-dimensional mean-field theories is drawing attention as
               a candidate for a universal and distinguishing unique feature of
               glasses. While among theoretical predictions, the non-Debye
               scaling has indeed been observed universally over various classes
               of glasses, the Gardner phase is found only in a limited portion
               of them. In this work, we numerically demonstrate that plastic
               events observed in two-dimensional Lennard-Jones glasses under
               quasistatic shear exhibit statistical properties that are
               qualitatively consistent with the picture of an infinitely
               hierarchical energy landscape associated with the Gardner phase.},

	abstract = {The distribution of local residual stresses (threshold to
                   instability) that controls the statistical properties of
                   plastic flow in athermal amorphous solids is examined with an
                   atomistic simulation technique. For quiescent configurations,
                   the distribution has a pseudogap (power-law) form with an
                   exponent that agrees well with global yielding statistics. As
                   soon as deformation sets in, the pseudogap region gives way
                   to a system size dependent plateau at small residual stresses
                   that can be understood from the statistics of local residual
                   stress {\em differences} between plastic events. Results
                   further suggest that the local yield stress in amorphous
                   solids changes even if the given region does not participate
                   in plastic activity.},

	abstract = {Abstract The dynamics of dislocations can be formulated in terms
               of the evolution of continuous variables representing dislocation
               densities ('continuum dislocation dynamics'). We show for various
               variants of this approach that the resulting models can be
               envisaged in terms of the evolution of order-parameter-like
               variables that strive to minimize a free energy functional which
               incorporates interface energy-like terms, i.e., as a phase field
               theory. We show that dislocation density variables obey
               non-standard conservation laws. These lead, in conjunction with
               the externally supplied work, to evolution equations that go
               beyond the classical framework of Allen-Cahn vs. Cahn-Hilliard
               equations. The approach is applied to the evolution of
               dislocation patterns in materials with B1(NaCl) lattice structure
               and it is demonstrated that it gives access to the formation of
               cellular dislocation patterns, and the concomitant emergence of
               both incidental and geometrically necessary dislocation
               boundaries.},

	abstract = {Abstract Mechanism based discrete dislocation dynamics framework
               for modelling plasticity in metallic materials with the
               morphology of the underlying grains resembling an actual
               microstructure is extended to incorporate a second-phase. The
               formulation includes mechanisms that account for dislocation
               self-interactions and interactions with grain boundaries
               vis-a-vis grain boundary slip transmission. Dislocation
               interactions within the constituent grains result in the
               entangling of dislocations, forming locks essential for
               controlling various hardening phenomena by obstructing
               dislocation motion or nucleating fresh dislocations. The presence
               of the second-phase particle on the emergent mechanical response
               is studied under various conditions. Results depict an increase
               in strain hardening rate with increasing second-phase volume
               fraction until a point where the dimensions of the second-phase
               approach the grain size. Further, the dislocation-grain boundary
               interactions in the presence of dislocation self-interactions on
               the strain hardening are also analyzed. Towards the end, the
               scaling of yield stress with grain size in the presence of the
               second-phase is also investigated. The analysis is aided by
               providing spatial distribution of relevant components of stress
               and geometrically necessary dislocation density, contributing to
               the essential hardening mechanisms that lead to the observed
               effects of second-phase on polycrystalline materials.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the mechanics of anelastic bodies with
               respect to a Riemannian and a Euclidean geometric structure on
               the material manifold. These two structures provide two
               equivalent sets of governing equations that correspond to the
               geometrical and classical approaches to non-linear anelasticity.
               This paper provides a parallelism between the two approaches and
               explains how to go from one to the other. We work in the setting
               of the multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradient seen
               as a non-holonomic change of frame in the material manifold. This
               allows one to define, in addition to the two geometric
               structures, a Weitzenb{\"{o}}ck connection on the material
               manifold. We use this connection to express natural uniformity in
               a geometrically meaningful way. The concept of uniformity is then
               extended to the Riemannian and Euclidean structures. Finally, we
               discuss the role of non-uniformity in the form of material forces
               that appear in the configurational form of the balance of linear
               momentum with respect to the two structures.},

	abstract = {Many systems in nature and the synthetic world involve ordered
               arrangements of units on two-dimensional surfaces. We review here
               the fundamental role payed by both the topology of the underlying
               surface and its Gaussian curvature. Topology dictates certain
               broad features of the defect structure of the ground state but
               curvature-driven energetics control the detailed structure of the
               ordered phases. Among the surprises are the appearance in the
               ground state of structures that would normally be thermal
               excitations and thus prohibited at zero temperature. Examples
               include excess dislocations in the form of grain boundary scars
               for spherical crystals above a minimal system size, dislocation
               unbinding for toroidal hexatics, interstitial fractionalization
               in spherical crystals and the appearance of well-separated
               disclinations for toroidal crystals. Much of the analysis leads
               to universal predictions that do not depend on the details of the
               microscopic interactions that lead to order in the first place.
               These predictions are subject to test by the many experimental
               soft- and hard-matter systems that lead to curved ordered
               structures such as colloidal particles self-assembling on
               droplets of one liquid in a second liquid. The defects themselves
               may be functionalized to create ligands with directional bonding.
               Thus, nano- to meso-scale superatoms may be designed with
               specific valency for use in building supermolecules and novel
               bulk materials. Parameters such as particle number, geometrical
               aspect ratios and anisotropy of elastic moduli permit the tuning
               of the precise architecture of the superatoms and associated
               supermolecules. Thus, the field has tremendous potential from

@article{Baggioli2022-nx,
	abstract = {We combine hydrodynamic and field theoretic methods to develop a
               general theory of phonons as Goldstone bosons in crystals,
               glasses, and liquids based on nonaffine displacements and the
               consequent Goldstone phase relaxation. We relate the
               conservation, or lack thereof, of specific higher-form currents
               with properties of the underlying deformation
               field-nonaffinity-which dictates how molecules move under an
               applied stress or deformation. In particular, the
               single-valuedness of the deformation field is associated with
               conservation of higher-form charges that count the number of
               topological defects. Our formalism predicts, from first
               principles, the presence of propagating shear waves above a
               critical wave vector in liquids, thus giving a formal derivation
               of the phenomenon in terms of fundamental symmetries. The same
               picture provides also a theoretical explanation of the
               corresponding ``positive sound dispersion'' phenomenon for
               longitudinal sound. Importantly, accordingly to our theory, the
               main collective relaxation timescale of a liquid or a glass
               (known as the $\alpha$ relaxation for the latter) is given by the
               phase relaxation time, which is not necessarily related to the
               Maxwell time. Finally, we build a nonequilibrium effective action
               using the in-in formalism defined on the Schwinger-Keldysh
               contour, that further supports the emerging picture. In summary,
               our work suggests that the fundamental difference between solids,
               fluids, and glasses has to be identified with the associated
               generalized higher-form global symmetries and their topological
               structure, and that the Burgers vector for the displacement

               metric. This characterization makes possible the identification
               of localized defects in amorphous materials, the formulation of a
               corresponding elastic problem, and its solution in various cases
               of physical interest. We present a multipole expansion that
               covers a large family of localized 2D defects. The dipole term,
               which represents a dislocation, is studied analytically and
               experimentally. Quadrupoles and higher multipoles correspond to
               fundamental strain-carrying entities. The interactions between

@article{Parley2024-jb,
	abstract = {Amorphous solids can yield in either a ductile or brittle manner
               under strain: plastic deformation can set in gradually, or
               abruptly through a macroscopic stress drop. Developing a unified
               theory describing both ductile and brittle yielding constitutes a
               fundamental challenge of nonequilibrium statistical physics.
               Recently, it has been proposed that, in the absence of thermal
               effects, the nature of the yielding transition is controlled by
               physics akin to that of the quasistatically driven random field
               Ising model (RFIM), which has served as the paradigm for
               understanding the effect of quenched disorder in slowly driven
               systems with short-ranged interactions. However, this theoretical
               picture neglects both the dynamics of, and the elasticity-induced
               long-ranged interactions between, the mesoscopic material
               constituents. Here, we address these two aspects and provide a
               unified theory building on the H\'{e}braud-Lequeux elastoplastic
               description. The first aspect is crucial to understanding the
               competition between the imposed deformation rate and the finite
               timescale of plastic rearrangements: We provide a dynamical
               description of the macroscopic stress drop, as well as
               predictions for the shifting of the brittle yield strain and the
               scaling of the peak susceptibility with inverse shear rate. The
               second is essential to capture properly the behavior in the limit
               of quasistatic driving, where avalanches of plasticity diverge
               with system size at any value of the strain. We fully
               characterise the avalanche behavior, which is radically different
               to that of the RFIM. In the quasistatic, infinite-size limit, we
               find that both models have mean-field Landau exponents, obscuring
               the effect of the interactions. We show, however, that the latter
               profoundly affect the behavior of finite systems approaching the
               spinodal-like brittle yield point, where we recover qualitatively
               the finite-size trends found in particle simulations. The
               interactions also modify the nature of the random critical point
               separating ductile and brittle yielding, where we predict
               critical behavior on top of the marginality present at any value
               of the strain. We finally discuss how all our predictions can be
               directly tested against particle simulations and eventually
               experiments, and make first steps in this direction.},

Plastic deformation is assumed to occur through a series of local reorganizations. Using a discretization of the mechanical fields on a discrete lattice, local reorganizations are modeled as local slip events. Local yield stresses are randomly distributed in space and invariant in time. Each plastic slip event induces an Eshelby-like long-ranged elastic stress redistribution. Focusing on quasi-static loadings and zero-temperature limit, extremal dynamics allows for recovering many of the complex features of amorphous plasticity observed experimentally and in numerical atomistic simulations in the quasi-static regime. In particular, a quantitative picture of localization, and of the anisotropic strain correlation both in the initial transient regime, and in the steady state are provided.},

               martensitic transformations occur in many materials, such as

               been the accepted theory for these transformations for more than

                 honeycomb materials is an important engineering
                 problem. Motivated by the pioneering experimental and
                 numerical studies of Papka and Kyriakides (1994,
                 1999a,b), we review the literature on finitely strained
                 honeycombs subjected to in-plane loading and identify
                 two open questions: (i) How does the mechanical
                 response of the honeycomb depend on the applied loading
                 device? and (ii) What can the Bloch wave representation
                 of all bounded perturbations contribute to our
                 understanding of the stability of post-bifurcated
                 equilibrium configurations? To address these issues we
                 model the honeycomb as a two-dimensional infinite
                 perfect periodic medium. We use analytical group theory
                 methods (as opposed to the more common, but less
                 robust, imperfection method) to study the honeycomb's
                 bifurcation behavior under three different far-field
                 loadings that produce (initially) the same equi-biaxial
                 contractive dilatation. Using an FEM discretization of
                 the honeycomb walls (struts), we solve the equilibrium
                 equations to find the principal and bifurcated
                 equilibrium paths for each of the three loading cases.
                 We evaluate the structure's stability using two
                 criteria: rank-one convexity of the homogenized
                 continuum (long wavelength perturbations) and Bloch
                 wave stability (bounded perturbations of arbitrary
                 wavelength). We find that the post-bifurcation behavior
                 is extremely sensitive to the applied loading device,
                 in spite of a common principal solution. We confirm
                 that the flower mode is always unstable, as previously
                 reported. However, our (first ever) Bloch wave
                 stability analysis of the post-bifurcated equilibrium
                 paths shows that the flower mode is stable for all
                 sufficiently short wavelength perturbations. This new
                 result provides a realistic explanation for why this
                 mode has been observed in the finite size specimen
                 experiments of Papka and Kyriakides (1999a).},

                 velocity field, explicitly accounting for the
                 relaxation of elastic excitations. This model captures
                 better than previous formulations the dynamics of
                 complex interfaces and dislocations in single crystals
                 as well as grain boundary migration in poly-crystals
                 where the long-range elastic field is properly relaxed.
                 The proposed model features a diffusivity that depends
                 non-linearly on the local phase. It induces more
                 localized interfaces between a disordered phase

                 mechanical equilibrium. However, in contrast to
                 previous approaches, it is not restricted to a
                 single-crystal configuration or small distortions from
                 a fixed reference lattice. To showcase the capabilities
                 of this approach, we consider a few examples, from the
                 annihilation of dislocation loops in a single crystal
                 at mechanical equilibrium to the relaxation of a
                 microstructure including crystalline domains with
                 different orientations and grain boundaries. During the
                 self-annihilation of a mixed type dislocation loop
                 (i.e., not shear or prismatic), long-range elastic
                 effects cause the loop to move out of plane before the
                 annihilation event.},

                 theoretical framework to study plastic flow due to
                 dislocation motion. We first obtain the elastic stress
                 from the phase field free energy and show that it obeys
                 the stress strain relation of linear elasticity.
                 Dislocations in a two dimensional hexagonal lattice are
                 shown to be composite topological defects in the
                 amplitude expansion of the phase field, with
                 topological charges given by the Burgers vector. This
                 allows us to introduce a formal relation between
                 dislocation velocity and the evolution of the coarse
                 grained envelopes of the phase field. Standard
                 dissipative dynamics of the phase field crystal model
                 is shown to determine the velocity of the dislocations.
                 When the amplitude equation is valid, we derive the
                 Peach-Koehler force on a dislocation, and compute the
                 associated defect mobility. A numerical integration of
                 the phase field crystal equations in two dimensions is
                 used to compute the motion of a dislocation dipole, and

                 science for problems, where atomic- and microscales are
                 tightly coupled. The PFC method operates on atomic
                 length and diffusive time scales, and thus constitutes
                 a computationally efficient alternative to molecular
                 simulation methods. Its intense development in

                 linked to the PFC approach to serve as further
                 theoretical fundamentals for the latter. In this

                 depends on the particular reflection used. It is shown
                 that the asymmetric line profiles are due to the
                 superposition of two mutually displaced symmetrically
                 broadened line profiles. These two sub-profiles can be
                 ascribed to the material located in the cell walls and
                 in the cell interiors of the dislocation cell

                 compute the local yield stresses at the atomic scale in
                 model two-dimensional Lennard-Jones glasses produced
                 via differing quench protocols. This technique allows
                 us to sample the plastic rearrangements in a
                 nonperturbative manner for different loading directions
                 on a well-controlled length scale. Plastic activity
                 upon shearing correlates strongly with the locations of
                 low yield stresses in the quenched states. This
                 correlation is higher in more structurally relaxed
                 systems. The distribution of local yield stresses is
                 also shown to strongly depend on the quench protocol:
                 the more relaxed the glass, the higher the local
                 plastic thresholds. Analysis of the magnitude of local
                 plastic relaxations reveals that stress drops follow
                 exponential distributions, justifying the hypothesis of
                 an average characteristic amplitude often conjectured
                 in mesoscopic or continuum models. The amplitude of the
                 local plastic rearrangements increases on average with
                 the yield stress, regardless of the system preparation.
                 The local yield stress varies with the shear
                 orientation tested and strongly correlates with the
                 plastic rearrangement locations when the system is
                 sheared correspondingly. It is thus argued that plastic
                 rearrangements are the consequence of shear
                 transformation zones encoded in the glass structure
                 that possess weak slip planes along different
                 orientations. Finally, we justify the length scale
                 employed in this work and extract the yield threshold
                 statistics as a function of the size of the probing
                 zones. This method makes it possible to derive
                 physically grounded models of plasticity for amorphous

                 power-law probability distribution with the avalanche
                 critical exponent $\tau$. Although the so-called
                 mean-field depinning (MFD) theory predicts a universal
                 value of this exponent, $\tau$\_{MFD}=1.5, such a
                 simplification is now known to connote qualitative
                 disagreement with realistic systems. Numerically and
                 experimentally, different values of $\tau$ have been
                 reported depending on the literature. Moreover, in the
                 elastic regime, it has been noted that the critical
                 exponent can be different from that in the steady
                 state, and even criticality itself is a matter of
                 debate. Because these confusingly varying results have
                 been reported under different setups, our knowledge of
                 avalanche criticality in sheared glasses is greatly
                 limited. To gain a unified understanding, in this work,
                 we conduct a comprehensive numerical investigation of
                 avalanches in Lennard-Jones glasses under athermal
                 quasistatic shear. In particular, by excluding the
                 ambiguity and arbitrariness that has crept into the
                 conventional measurement schemes, we achieve
                 high-precision measurement and demonstrate that the
                 exponent $\tau$ in the steady state follows the
                 prediction of MFD theory, $\tau$\_{MFD}=1.5. Our
                 results also suggest that there are two qualitatively
                 different avalanche events. This binariness leads to
                 the nonuniversal behavior of the avalanche size
                 distribution and is likely to be the cause of the
                 varying values of $\tau$ reported thus far. To
                 investigate the dependence of criticality and
                 universality on applied shear, we further study the
                 statistics of avalanches in the elastic regime and the
                 ensemble of the first avalanche event in different
                 samples, which provide information about the
                 unperturbed system. We show that while the unperturbed
                 system is indeed off-critical, criticality gradually
                 develops as shear is applied. The degree of criticality
                 is encoded in the fractal dimension of the avalanches,
                 which starts from zero in the off-critical unperturbed
                 state and saturates in the steady state. Moreover, the
                 critical exponent $\tau$ is consistent with the
                 prediction of the MFD $\tau$\_{MFD} universally,
                 regardless of the amount of applied shear, once the
                 system becomes critical.},

                 interactions is implemented. Only the effect of a
                 plastic disorder is considered. Numerical results show
                 a complex size dependence of the effective flow stress
                 of the amorphous composite. In particular, the
                 departure from the mixing law shows opposite trends
                 associated to the competing effects of the matrix and
                 the reinforcing particles, respectively. The
                 reinforcing mechanisms and their effects on

                 reinforcement size effects in (logN/N)(1/2), where N is

                 solid is a fundamental challenge in statistical
                 physics, during which no apparent structural ordering
                 appears. In the athermal limit, the two states are
                 connected by a well-defined jamming transition, near
                 which the solid is marginally stable. A recent
                 mechanical response screening theory proposes an
                 additional transition above jamming, called a
                 plastic-to-elastic transition here, separating
                 anomalous and quasielastic mechanical behavior. Through
                 numerical inflation simulations in two dimensions, we
                 show that the onsets of long-range radial and angular
                 correlations of particle displacements decouple,
                 occurring, respectively, at the jamming and
                 plastic-to-elastic transitions. The latter is
                 characterized by a power-law diverging correlation
                 angle and a power-law spectrum of the displacements
                 along a circle. This work establishes two-step

                 ``decompression melting'' of an athermal overjammed
                 amorphous solid, reminiscent of the two-step structural
                 melting of a crystal in two dimensions. In

                 particles are caged by their neighbours and thus cannot

                 energy landscape containing multiple minima (basins)
                 separated by high barriers. Here we show, using theory
                 and numerical simulation, that the landscape is much
                 rougher than is classically assumed. Deep in the glass,
                 it undergoes a 'roughness transition' to fractal
                 basins, which brings about isostaticity and marginal
                 stability on approaching jamming. Critical exponents
                 for the basin width, the weak force distribution and
                 the spatial spread of quasi-contacts near jamming can
                 be analytically determined. Their value is found to be
                 compatible with numerical observations. This advance
                 incorporates the jamming transition of granular
                 materials into the framework of glass theory. Because

                 nonequilibrium patterns on the other, using the
                 Ginzburg--Landau theory as a unified language. In the
                 first part, mean-field theory is presented, for both
                 statics and dynamics, and its validity tested
                 self-consistently. As is well known, the mean-field
                 approximation breaks down below four spatial
                 dimensions, where it can be replaced by a scaling
                 phenomenology. The Ginzburg--Landau formalism can then
                 be used to justify the phenomenological theory using
                 the renormalization group, which elucidates the
                 physical and mathematical mechanism for universality.
                 In the second part of the paper it is shown how near
                 pattern forming linear instabilities of dynamical
                 systems, a formally similar Ginzburg--Landau theory can

                 kinematics, which accounts for the shifts of the

                 This approach is referred to as Cascading Cauchy--Born

                 roughness of persistent slip bands (PSBs) is presented.
                 The physical background of the model is the existence
                 of a dynamic equilibrium between dislocation
                 multiplication and annihilation in PSBs which leads to
                 irreversible microscopic positive and negative slip
                 steps at the surface. The fluctuation of a random
                 distribution of these slip line segments leads to a
                 surface roughness which increases with the square root
                 of the cycle number. The relation between the
                 parameters which characterize the surface relief and
                 the microscopic parameters which control the
                 dislocation glide in PSBs is investigated by computer
                 simulations. Fair agreement is obtained between

                 training, tensor decomposition, and matrix
                 factorization require local minimization of a nonconvex
                 function. This local minimization is challenged by the
                 presence of saddle points, of which there can be many
                 and from which descent methods may take an inordinately
                 large number of iterations to escape. This paper
                 presents a second-order method that modifies the update
                 of Newton's method by replacing the negative
                 eigenvalues of the Hessian by their absolute values and
                 uses a truncated version of the resulting matrix to
                 account for the objective's curvature. The method is
                 shown to escape saddles in at most $1 + \log_\{3/2\}
                 (\delta/2\varepsilon)$ iterations, where $\varepsilon$

                 expressions are self-consistent in that the driving

                 the classical continuum theory is removed here by
                 spreading the Burgers vector isotropically about every

	abstract = {A phase-field theory of dislocation dynamics, strain
                 hardening and hysteresis in ductile single crystals is
                 developed. The theory accounts for: an arbitrary number
                 and arrangement of dislocation lines over a slip plane;
                 the long-range elastic interactions between dislocation
                 lines; the core structure of the dislocations resulting
                 from a piecewise quadratic Peierls potential; the
                 interaction between the dislocations and an applied
                 resolved shear stress field; and the irreversible
                 interactions with short-range obstacles and lattice
                 friction, resulting in hardening, path dependency and
                 hysteresis. A chief advantage of the present theory is
                 that it is analytically tractable, in the sense that
                 the complexity of the calculations may be reduced, with
                 the aid of closed form analytical solutions, to the
                 determination of the value of the phase field at
                 point-obstacle sites. In particular, no numerical grid
                 is required in calculations. The phase-field
                 representation enables complex geometrical and
                 topological transitions in the dislocation ensemble,
                 including dislocation loop nucleation, bow-out,
                 pinching, and the formation of Orowan loops. The theory
                 also permits the consideration of obstacles of varying
                 strengths and dislocation line-energy anisotropy. The
                 theory predicts a range of behaviors which are in
                 qualitative agreement with observation, including:
                 hardening and dislocation multiplication in single slip
                 under monotonic loading; the Bauschinger effect under
                 reverse loading; the fading memory effect, whereby
                 reverse yielding gradually eliminates the influence of
                 previous loading; the evolution of the dislocation
                 density under cycling loading, leading to
                 characteristic `butterfly' curves; and others.},

                 starts with an overview of the important physical
                 mechanisms of defect evolution and the significant gaps
                 in simulating microstructure evolution in irradiated
                 nuclear materials. Then, the phase field method is
                 introduced as a powerful and predictive tool and its
                 applications to microstructure and property evolution
                 in irradiated nuclear materials are reviewed. The
                 review shows that (1) Phase field models can correctly
                 describe important phenomena such as spatial-dependent
                 generation, migration, and recombination of defects,
                 radiation-induced dissolution, the Soret effect, strong
                 interfacial energy anisotropy, and elastic interaction;
                 (2) The phase field method can qualitatively and
                 quantitatively simulate two-dimensional and
                 three-dimensional microstructure evolution, including
                 radiation-induced segregation, second phase nucleation,

                 Among the many unique and attractive properties of 2D

                 in manufacturing, integration and performance for their
                 potential applications. Mechanics is indispensable in
                 the study of mechanical properties, both experimentally
                 and theoretically. The coupling between the mechanical
                 and other physical properties (thermal, electronic,

	abstract = {When implementing functionality which requires sparse
                 matrices, there are numerous storage formats to choose
                 from, each with advantages and disadvantages. To
                 achieve good performance, several formats may need to
                 be used in one program, requiring explicit selection
                 and conversion between the formats. This can be both
                 tedious and error-prone, especially for non-expert
                 users. Motivated by this issue, we present a
                 user-friendly sparse matrix class for the C++ language,
                 with a high-level application programming interface
                 deliberately similar to the widely used MATLAB
                 language. The class internally uses two main approaches
                 to achieve efficient execution: (i) a hybrid storage
                 framework, which automatically and seamlessly switches
                 between three underlying storage formats (compressed
                 sparse column, coordinate list, Red-Black tree)
                 depending on which format is best suited for specific
                 operations, and (ii) template-based meta-programming to
                 automatically detect and optimise execution of common
                 expression patterns. To facilitate relatively quick
                 conversion of research code into production
                 environments, the class and its associated functions
                 provide a suite of essential sparse linear algebra
                 functionality (eg., arithmetic operations, submatrix
                 manipulation) as well as high-level functions for
                 sparse eigendecompositions and linear equation solvers.
                 The latter are achieved by providing easy-to-use
                 abstractions of the low-level ARPACK and SuperLU
                 libraries. The source code is open and provided under

                 which is consistent with a quadrupolar source acting on

                 to the next, and these transient lines of slip are not
                 to be confounded with the persistent regions of
                 localized shear--so-called ``shear bands''--found in

                 scalings with system length of various measures of

                 itself as a potent means of producing bulk ultrafine
                 grained and nanostructured materials. It has given rise
                 to burgeoning research that has become an integral part
                 of the present day materials science. This research has
                 received a broad coverage in literature, and several
                 recent publications (including reviews in Progress in

                 the history, the current status, and the potential
                 applications of SPD technologies. There is one aspect
                 of SPD-related research, though, which despite its
                 great importance has not been covered by any
                 substantive review, viz. the modelling and simulation
                 work. Due to the complexity of SPD processing and the
                 specificity of material behaviour at the extremely
                 large strains involved, analytical and computational
                 studies have been indispensable for process design,
                 parameter optimisation, and the prediction of the

                 Now we prove that this model can be used for computer

                 extensive reporting of two-dimensional (2D) ice on

                 Although structured water adlayers and 2D ice have been
                 imaged, capturing the metastable or intermediate edge
                 structures involved in the 2D ice growth, which could
                 reveal the underlying growth mechanisms, is extremely
                 challenging, owing to the fragility and short lifetime
                 of those edge structures. Here we show that noncontact
                 atomic-force microscopy with a CO-terminated tip (used
                 previously to image interfacial water with minimal
                 perturbation)12, enables real-space imaging of the edge
                 structures of 2D bilayer hexagonal ice grown on a
                 Au(111) surface. We find that armchair-type edges
                 coexist with the zigzag edges usually observed in 2D
                 hexagonal crystals, and freeze these samples during
                 growth to identify the intermediate edge structures.
                 Combined with simulations, these experiments enable us
                 to reconstruct the growth processes that, in the case
                 of the zigzag edge, involve the addition of water
                 molecules to the existing edge and a collective
                 bridging mechanism. Armchair edge growth, by contrast,
                 involves local seeding and edge reconstruction and thus
                 contrasts with conventional views regarding the growth
                 of bilayer hexagonal ices and 2D hexagonal matter in

                 nucleation in a broad range of fields and applications.
                 Here we present a fundamental framework for describing
                 incipient plasticity that combines results of atomistic
                 and finite-element modelling, theoretical concepts of
                 structural stability at finite strain, and experimental
                 analysis. We quantify two key features of the
                 nucleation and subsequent evolution of defects. A
                 position-sensitive criterion based on elastic stability
                 determines the location and character of homogeneously

                 matter in athermal, quasistatic (a-AQS), steady-state
                 shear flow. In particular, we perform a careful
                 analysis of the scaling with the lateral system size L
                 of (i) statistics of individual relaxation events in
                 terms of stress relaxation S, and individual event
                 mean-squared displacement M, and the subsequent load
                 increments $\Delta$$\gamma$, required to initiate the
                 next event; (ii) static properties of the system
                 encoded by x=$\sigma$\_\{y\}-$\sigma$, the distance of
                 local stress values from threshold; and (iii) long-time
                 correlations and the emergence of diffusive behavior.
                 For the event statistics, we find that the distribution
                 of S is similar to, but distinct from, the distribution
                 of M. We find a strong correlation between S and M for
                 any particular event, with S∼M^\{q\} with
                 q$\approx$0.65. The exponent q completely determines
                 the scaling exponents for P(M) given those for P(S).
                 For the distribution of local thresholds, we find P(x)
                 is analytic at x=0, and has a value
                 P(x)|\_\{x=0\}=p\_\{0\} which scales with lateral
                 system length as p\_\{0\}∝L^\{-0.6\}. The size
                 dependence of the average load increment
                 〈$\Delta$$\gamma$〉 appears to be asymptotically
                 controlled by the plateau behavior of P(x) rather than
                 by a subsequent apparent power-law behavior. Extreme
                 value statistics arguments lead thus to a scaling
                 relation between the exponents governing P(x) and those
                 governing P(S). Finally, we study the long-time
                 correlations via single-particle tracer statistics. The
                 value of the diffusion coefficient is completely
                 determined by 〈$\Delta$$\gamma$〉 and the scaling
                 properties of P(M) (in particular from 〈M〉) rather
                 than directly from P(S) as one might have naively
                 guessed. Our results (i) further define the a-AQS
                 universality class, (ii) clarify the relation between
                 avalanches of stress relaxation and diffusive behavior,
                 and (iii) clarify the relation between local threshold
                 distributions and event statistics.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents a brief
                 overview of work hardening. The turbulent flow of
                 fluids is the most difficult remaining problem in
                 classical physics. Work hardening is worse. The great
                 complicating feature of fluid flow---the presence of
                 non-linear inertial energy terms in the basic
                 equations---is ordinarily absent from work hardening. A
                 crucial assumption in all standard theories of plastic
                 deformation is that, dislocations move
                 ``non-relativistically,'' implying that when
                 accelerating among separate obstacles they do not
                 accumulate and store enough kinetic energy to help them
                 significantly in overcoming these obstacles. In other
                 words, the entire theory is quasi-static. If there were
                 a significant dynamic effect of fast dislocation
                 motion, crystal plasticity would show many features
                 different from those actually observed. The chapter
                 presents classical evidence and electron microscopic
                 evidence of work hardening. The general feature exposed
                 by the electron microscopic observations are that work
                 hardened dislocation structures is heterogeneous on a
                 mesoscopic scale. This set two new problems for the
                 theory: to deduce the flow stress from the starting
                 point of a given observed heterogeneous structure, and
                 to explain the formation of these structures and their
                 evolution with plastic strain. The first of these have
                 proved to be the easier and more fully developed.},

                 techniques exist that address the length scales
                 relevant to deformation pro- cesses, including
                 dislocation dynamics (DD), which models the interaction
                 and evolution of discrete dislocation line segments,
                 and crystal plasticity (CP), which incorporates the
                 crystalline nature and restricted motion of dis-
                 locations into a higher scale continuous field
                 framework. While these two methods are conceptually
                 related, there have been only nominal efforts focused
                 on the system-level material response that use
                 DD-generated information to enhance the fidelity of
                 plasticity models. To ascertain to what degree the
                 predictions of CP are consistent with those of DD, we
                 compare their global and microstructural response in a

                 developments are concisely outlined. The classical
                 theory of dislocation fields is introduced first for
                 static and dynamic dislocation configurations, followed
                 by a brief discussion of the shortcomings of the
                 classical theory in predicting plasticity of crystals.
                 In this regard, the lack of connection between the
                 evolution of the dislocation field and internal stress
                 state of the crystal is particularly highlighted. The

                 asymmetry of copper single crystals. In addition to the
                 perfect crystal, crystals with stacking fault
                 tetrahedra, as a representative internal defect, are
                 considered to investigate both homogeneous and
                 heterogeneous deformation mechanisms. Both the normal
                 stresses to the slip plane and the relative values of
                 Schmid factor in compression and tension impact the C/T
                 asymmetry. The presence of an SFT lowers the applied
                 stress required for plastic deformation, but this
                 effect is highly dependent on the crystal orientation
                 and loading direction. The reduction in yield stress is

                 provides a canonical framework of finite plasticity
                 with physically well-defined roots in the dislocation
                 mechanics of metals. Reliable algorithmic settings of
                 crystal plasticity are not only needed for structural
                 analyses of single crystals but also provide a
                 cornerstone for multiscale computations of evolving
                 anisotropic microstructures in metallic polycrystals.
                 This article summarizes a current status of
                 computational crystal plasticity and its application to
                 the texture analysis of polycrystals. It outlines a
                 basic constitutive structure of crystal plasticity,
                 alternative deformation-driven stress update algorithms
                 and a computational scheme for the nonlinear
                 homogenization of polycrystalline aggregates.
                 Particular emphasis is put on a canonical incremental
                 variational formulation for Schmid-type crystal
                 plasticity with potential hardening where an
                 incremental stress potential is obtained from a local
                 minimization problem with respect to the internal
                 variables. The existence of this stress potential
                 allows the formulation of IBVPs for elastic?plastic
                 crystals as a sequence of incremental minimization
                 problems. Furthermore, the nonlinear homogenization of
                 polycrystalline microstructures may be recast into a
                 principle of minimum averaged incremental energy.
                 Within this variational setting of homogenization, a
                 quasi-hyperelastic incremental macro-stress potential
                 is obtained from a global minimization problem with
                 respect to the fine-scale displacement fluctuation
                 field. The performance of the formulations is
                 demonstrated for benchmarks of single crystal

                 systems, photonics and biotechnology. However, the
                 elastic-plastic transition observed in silicon is not
                 fully understood; in particular, it is not known if the
                 plasticity of silicon is determined by dislocations or
                 by transformations between phases. Here, based on
                 compression experiments and molecular dynamics

                 silicon nanoparticles are less constrained and display

                 (tensorial) description of the elastic interactions in
                 the system and the possibility of structural
                 reaccommodations that are responsible for the plastic
                 behavior. The possible structural reaccommodations are
                 encoded in the form of a ``plastic disorder''
                 potential, which is chosen independently at each
                 position of the sample to account for local
                 heterogeneities. We observe that the stress must exceed
                 a critical value $\sigma$\_\{c\} in order for the
                 system to yield. In addition, when the system yields a

                 to depend on some details of the plastic disorder
                 potential. For smooth potentials a value of
                 $\beta$≃2.0 is obtained, whereas for potentials
                 obtained as a concatenation of smooth pieces a value

                 indicates a dependence of critical behavior on details

                 out nonessential, harmonic degrees of freedom, we
                 derive a simplified scalar version of the model that
                 represents a collection of interacting
                 Prandtl-Tomlinson particles. A mean-field treatment of
                 this interaction reproduces the difference of $\beta$

                 inversely dependent on the plastic strain/dislocation
                 density induced by the applied tensile pre-stress;
                 consequently, we argue that small-depth indentation may
                 be useful for identifying bulk plastic yielding
                 behavior prior to indentation. In contrast, for larger
                 indentation depths, pre-stress has no effect on
                 hardness. However, effect of pre-stress can be revealed
                 through plastic events statistics, both in load and
                 displacement controlled protocols. Moreover,
                 post-indentation surface morphology clearly shows the
                 effect of the pre-stress.},

                 Al0.1CoCrFeNi, using direct electron imaging and

                 form in front of the dislocation bands, whose giveaway
                 trigs the avalanche, like the opening of a floodgate.

                 102 nm in the nanopillars, with the power-law

                 electronic interactions, metals with the same valence
                 electron configuration usually exhibit a similar
                 plastic behaviour. For this reason, titanium and
                 zirconium, two transition metals of technological
                 importance from the same column of the periodic table,
                 have so far been assumed to deform in a similar

                 that plasticity proceeds very differently in these two
                 metals, being intermittent in Ti and continuous in Zr.
                 This observation is rationalized using first-principles
                 calculations, which reveal that, in both metals,
                 dislocations may adopt the same set of different cores

                 ``push-to-pull'' device in conjunction with a
                 nanoindenter in a transmission electron microscope.
                 Digital image correlation was used to determine stress
                 and strain in local areas of deformation. When they had
                 no initial dislocations the Mo alloy nanofibers
                 suffered sudden catastrophic elongation following
                 elastic deformation to ultrahigh stresses. At the other
                 extreme fibers with a high dislocation density
                 underwent sustained homogeneous deformation after
                 yielding at much lower stresses. Between these two
                 extremes nanofibers with intermediate dislocation
                 densities demonstrated a clear exhaustion hardening

                 with the idea that mechanical size effects (``smaller

                 usually have fewer defects that can operate at lower

                 energy and effective mass of a single dislocation
                 increase logarithmically with the size of the specimen.
                 A pair of dislocations of opposite sign in the same
                 glide plane cannot be in stable equilibrium unless they
                 are separated by a distance of the order of 10 000
                 lattice spacings. If an external shear stress is
                 applied there is a critical separation of the pair of
                 dislocations at which they are in unstable equilibrium.
                 The energy of this unstable state is the activation
                 energy for the formation of a pair of dislocations. It
                 depends on the external shear, and for practical
                 stresses is of the order of 7 electron volts per atomic
                 plane. The size and energy of dislocations in real
                 crystals are unlikely to differ greatly from those
                 calculated: the stress required to move a dislocation
                 and the critical separation of two dislocations may be
                 seriously in error.},

                 composite micropillars are not due to the load-sharing
                 effect of the incorporated tungsten phase. Transmission
                 electron microscopy examination reveals that the
                 coating or filling traps dislocations inside the
                 crystals, thus raising the stored dislocation density
                 by up to three orders of magnitude. This study
                 indicates that microcrystals can be significantly
                 strain-hardened and their deformation behavior can
                 become more controllable when dislocations are confined
                 inside them.},

                 three-dimensional molecular dynamics model of silica
                 glass under quasistatic shear. We identify two distinct

                 quasilocalized atomic rearrangement while the second is
                 a bond-breaking event that is absent in simplified
                 models of fragile glass formers. Our results show that
                 both plastic events can be predicted by a drop of the
                 lowest nonzero eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix that

                 efficiently---those with short-range forces where the

                 implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine
                 which allows for message-passing of data between
                 independently executing processors. The algorithms are
                 tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem

                 has emerged, with the goal of reaching a quantitative

	abstract = {This paper systematically summarizes the cyclic
                 deformation behaviors of different kinds of
                 face-centered cubic (fcc) single crystals, including
                 copper, nickel, silver, as well as copper--aluminium,
                 copper--zinc alloys in attempt to provide a historical
                 perspective of the developments over the last several
                 decades. Combined with plenty of previous research
                 results, the influencing factors on cyclic deformation
                 behaviors can be listed as follows: orientations,
                 stacking fault energy (SFE), short-range order (SRO)
                 and friction stress, or more generally, the ease of
                 cross slip. Among them, the effect of orientations
                 mainly reflects in the formation of the complex
                 dislocation patterns, which depends on the activating
                 secondary slip system. According to the effect of slip
                 mode, the materials can be divided into two types: pure
                 metals and alloys. For pure fcc metals, the effect of
                 SFE is decisive. Due to the easy cross slip of screw
                 dislocations, regular dislocation arrangements, e.g.
                 veins, persistent slip bands (PSBs), labyrinth and cell
                 patterns, are always to form. With increase in alloying
                 element, antiphase boundary energy gradually replaces
                 SFE to become a new decisive factor affecting the
                 cyclic deformation behaviors of fcc alloy single
                 crystals. The corresponding dislocation arrangements
                 consist of dipole array and stacking faults (SFs) under
                 the influence of planar slip. The relationship among
                 several factors is well explained, which will help us
                 better understand the nature of the fatigue damage of
                 metallic materials and then improve the performance of
                 the related materials.},

	abstract = {Microindentation experiments have recently shown that
                 silicon can exhibit plastic flow when subjected to high
                 pressure. Assuming that under these conditions the
                 relevant reference structure is the $\beta$-Sn
                 high-pressure phase of silicon, we apply the
                 magic-strain concept to explore the space of
                 configurations that could describe the observed
                 behavior. We use first-principles total-energy
                 calculations (including full relaxation of the atomic
                 basis for every structure) to evaluate the relevance of
                 strained configurations. Using this approach, we were
                 able to identify a low-energy path that corresponds to
                 planar flow of the atoms. The atomic configurations
                 along this path provide insight into possible
                 microscopic motions under high pressure that may be
                 relevant to plastic flow in silicon.},

@article{Fedelich1992-gz,
	abstract = {We study in this paper the hysteretic behavior of a
                 discrete system constituted by a finite number of
                 elements (``snap-springs'') whose energy has two
                 parabolic wells. The guideline idea is that, in many
                 circumstances, hysteresis can be due to the presence of
                 relative minimizers of a potential (``metastable
                 states'') in which the system might get locked during
                 its quasistatic evolution. A careful investigation is
                 thus carried out of the relative minimizers of the
                 total energy of our system of snap-springs under
                 imposed total displacement, and of the barriers
                 separating them. This is done both in the case of
                 noninteracting elements and in the case in which some
                 interaction is present that gives rise in the energy to
                 an extra ``coherence'' term of special form. The
                 results allow discussion of various hysteretic
                 phenomena, also in the presence of vibrational motion
                 of the elements. This study of a simple but suggestive
                 discrete system will hopefully prove itself of help in
                 understanding the implications regarding hysteresis of
                 certain continuum theories recently proposed to model
                 phase transitions in the solid state, in which the
                 energy density is assumed, as here, to be biparabolic,
                 and in which the coherence energy term we adopt arises
                 in a natural way when equilibria involving mixtures of
                 kinematically noncoherent phases are considered. In
                 these cases the optimal microstructures are known to be
                 layered, and physically this gives a good basis to our
                 discrete calculation.},

                 It is argued that this effect is caused by geometrical
                 constraints on the nucleation and motion of
                 dislocations in submicrometre-sized crystals. Here, we
                 report the first in situ transmission electron
                 microscopy tensile tests of a submicrometre aluminium
                 single crystal that are capable of providing direct
                 insight into source-controlled dislocation plasticity
                 in a submicrometre crystal. Single-ended sources emit
                 dislocations that escape the crystal before being able
                 to multiply. As dislocation nucleation and loss rates
                 are counterbalanced at about 0.2 events per second, the
                 dislocation density remains statistically constant
                 throughout the deformation at strain rates of about
                 10(-4) s(-1). However, a sudden increase in strain rate
                 to 10(-3) s(-1) causes a noticeable surge in
                 dislocation density as the nucleation rate outweighs
                 the loss rate. This observation indicates that the
                 deformation of submicrometre crystals is strain-rate
                 sensitive.},

                 irradiation, shock loading or severe mechanical
                 deformation. Such extreme conditions impose significant
                 challenges on the direct observation of the
                 amorphization process. Various experimental techniques
                 have been used to detect how the amorphous phases form,
                 including synchrotron X-ray diffraction, transmission
                 electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy, but a
                 dynamic, atomistic characterization has remained
                 elusive. Here, by using in situ high-resolution TEM
                 (HRTEM), we show the dynamic amorphization process in
                 silicon nanocrystals during mechanical straining on the

                 diamond-cubic (dc) to diamond-hexagonal (dh) phase

                 and accumulation in the newly formed dh-Si phase. This
                 process leads to the formation of an amorphous Si
                 (a-Si) band, embedded with dh-Si nanodomains. The

                 crystalline materials can be accurately modeled using
                 the concept of geometrically necessary dislocations.
                 The model leads to the following characteristic form
                 for the depth dependence of the hardness: HH01+h∗h
                 where H is the hardness for a given depth of
                 indentation, h, H0 is the hardness in the limit of
                 infinite depth and h∗ is a characteristic length that
                 depends on the shape of the indenter, the shear modulus
                 and H0. Indentation experiments on annealed (111)
                 copper single crystals and cold worked polycrystalline
                 copper show that this relation is well-obeyed. We also
                 show that this relation describes the indentation size
                 effect observed for single crystals of silver. We use
                 this model to derive the following law for strain
                 gradient plasticity: ($\sigma$$\sigma$0)2 = 1 +
                 l̂$\chi$, where $\sigma$ is the effective flow stress
                 in the presence of a gradient, $\sigma$0 is the flow
                 stress in the absence of a gradient, $\chi$ is the
                 effective strain gradient and l̂ a characteristic
                 material length scale, which is, in turn, related to
                 the flow stress of the material in the absence of a
                 strain gradient, l̂ $\approx$ b($\mu$$\sigma$0)2. For
                 materials characterized by the power law $\sigma$0 =
                 $\sigma$ref$\epsilon$1n, the above law can be recast in
                 a form with a strain-independent material length scale
                 l. (built$\sigma$$\sigma$ref)2 = $\epsilon$2n + l$\chi$
                 l = b($\mu$$\sigma$ref)2 = l̂($\sigma$0$\sigma$ref)2.
                 This law resembles the phenomenological law developed

                 Traction-free finite-sized samples were used.

                 gradient crystal plasticity theory. Hardening models
                 are associated with the density of geometrically
                 necessary dislocations. Size effects observed in the
                 present calculations are governed by the development of
                 slip-bands in the micropillar and the geometrically
                 necessary dislocations that build up around them. Two
                 critical factors are identified as defining the
                 slip-band behavior. One is the aspect ratio considered
                 for the micropillar. Shorter micropillars introduce
                 geometrical restrictions to the free path for
                 dislocations in the slip-band, which may result in the
                 development of a substantial amount of geometrically
                 necessary dislocations and size dependent hardening
                 (strain hardening and strengthening). In longer
                 micropillars the effect is not observed and then the
                 proposed model is incapable of capturing size effects
                 in these cases. The other factor is the hardening model
                 used. Two possible models are considered: a dissipative
                 model directly related to slip rate gradients and an
                 energetic model derived from a defect energy.
                 Qualitative comparisons with experiments indicate that
                 dissipative hardening is a more adequate representation
                 of micropillar compression than the energetic model
                 used. Finally, it is shown that a large friction
                 between punch and crystal may inhibit strengthening
                 converting it into strain hardening. Low friction
                 coefficients also tend to promote the concentration of

                 components are now regularly being fabricated for use
                 in a wide variety of new applications. These systems
                 exhibit mechanical properties that can be drastically
                 different from their macroscopic counterparts and
                 recently much work has focused on the size effects on
                 the mechanical behaviour of materials. Although the
                 size dependent behaviour has been observed in all of
                 the crystal structures, the governing mechanisms have
                 been found to be different. Different theories have
                 been proposed to describe the size dependent behaviour
                 of metallic samples and the governing mechanisms and it
                 is well known that the surface plays an important role
                 in the plasticity of small scales. Some of the theories
                 indicate the importance of surface in nucleating
                 dislocation and some other ones consider the surface
                 importance as its effect on truncating dislocation
                 loops and activation of internal sources. Moreover,
                 recent studies have revealed that while dislocation
                 based deformation in fcc metals is not very sensitive
                 to temperature, deformation is strongly temperature
                 dependent in bcc metals. The effect of orientation is
                 more clear in the size scale behavior of hcp metals.
                 This review covers recent literature that has focused
                 on uniaxial compression of single crystals at the
                 sub-micron and nanometer scale. The fundamental
                 mechanisms governing the size dependent mechanical
                 behaviour of different crystal structures are
                 described. The effect of fabrication process and
                 current experimental techniques for micro and

                 1n(R/b) with R range of the dislocation stress field
                 from the axis. This equation implies that quasi-uniform
                 distributions are unstable relative to dislocation
                 clusters in which neighboring dislocations mutually
                 screen their stress fields, correspondingly leaving the
                 major fraction of the volume free of dislocations. The
                 value of R decreases in the following order: pile-ups
                 to dipolar mats, Taylor lattices, tilt and dipolar
                 walls to dislocation cell structures. This is the same
                 order in which dislocation structures tend to develop
                 with increasing dislocation density and hence increased
                 dislocation interactions, leading to the corresponding
                 energy decrease per unit length of dislocation line.
                 Taking into consideration also the longer-range
                 ``termination stresses'' of finite dislocation
                 boundaries, and minimizing the total energy, explains
                 the size dependence of cells on stress as well as the
                 occasionally observed pattern of rectangular cells with
                 alternating left-right rotation about a common axis.
                 Energy minimization further explains the transition
                 from stage I to II in f.c.c. metals. The following
                 topics which are at the present frontier of research
                 are considered in this paper: (i) the sum of the energy
                 stored in the dislocation line energy and the
                 longer-range stresses is significantly smaller than
                 some recently reported experimental values; (ii)
                 subdivision of cells is discussed on the basis of
                 observations in rolled aluminum showing a
                 ``hierarchical'' cell structure; (iii) suggestions are
                 made to account for microband formation on the basis of
                 energy minimization. Finally, the relationship between
                 surface markings and the underlying dislocation

                 micromechanical modelling in the phase-field approach
                 applied to dislocation dynamics. The intention is
                 two-fold. On the one hand, modelling of dislocation
                 dynamics is a very recent field of development in
                 phase-field theory, in comparison to the simulation of
                 diffusional phase transformation and related
                 microstructure evolution problems in materials science.
                 The reason is that modelling dislocation dynamics poses
                 several challenges for phase-field concepts which go
                 beyond purely diffusional problems in materials science
                 such as, e.g. dendritic solidification, as we point out
                 in Section 3. On the other hand, the modelling of
                 dislocations has triggered further wide-ranging
                 developments of phase-field based models for
                 deformation problems. This is an important development,

                 degrees of freedom from the atomic scale to the
                 microscale. This is something phase-field theory is

	abstract = {The fundamental processes that govern plasticity and
                 determine strength in crystalline materials at small
                 length scales have been studied for over fifty years.
                 Recent studies of single-crystal metallic pillars with
                 diameters of a few tens of micrometres or less have
                 clearly demonstrated that the strengths of these
                 pillars increase as their diameters decrease, leading
                 to attempts to augment existing ideas about pronounced
                 size effects with new models and simulations. Through
                 in situ nanocompression experiments inside a
                 transmission electron microscope we can directly
                 observe the deformation of these pillar structures and
                 correlate the measured stress values with discrete
                 plastic events. Our experiments show that submicrometre
                 nickel crystals microfabricated into pillar structures
                 contain a high density of initial defects after
                 processing but can be made dislocation free by applying
                 purely mechanical stress. This phenomenon, termed
                 'mechanical annealing', leads to clear evidence of
                 source-limited deformation where atypical hardening
                 occurs through the progressive activation and
                 exhaustion of dislocation sources.},

	abstract = {The mechanical failure of amorphous media is a
                 ubiquitous phenomenon from material engineering to
                 geology. It has been noticed for a long time that the
                 phenomenon is ``scale-free,'' indicating some type of
                 criticality. In spite of attempts to invoke
                 ``Self-Organized Criticality,'' the physical origin of
                 this criticality, and also its universal nature, being
                 quite insensitive to the nature of microscopic
                 interactions, remained elusive. Recently we proposed
                 that the precise nature of this critical behavior is
                 manifested by a spinodal point of a thermodynamic phase
                 transition. Demonstrating this requires the
                 introduction of an ``order parameter'' that is suitable
                 for distinguishing between disordered amorphous
                 systems. At the spinodal point there exists a divergent
                 correlation length which is associated with the
                 system-spanning instabilities (known also as shear
                 bands) which are typical to the mechanical yield. The
                 theory, the order parameter used and the correlation
                 functions which exhibit the divergent correlation
                 length are universal in nature and can be applied to
                 any amorphous solid that undergoes mechanical yield.
                 The phenomenon is seen at its sharpest in athermal
                 systems, as is explained below; in this paper we extend
                 the discussion also to thermal systems, showing that at
                 sufficiently high temperatures the spinodal phenomenon
                 is destroyed by thermal fluctuations.},

                 Ti--6Al--4V is developed and implemented. The model
                 includes length scale effects associated with
                 dislocation interactions with different microstructure
                 features, and is calibrated using polycrystalline
                 finite element simulations to fit the measured
                 macroscopic responses (overall stress--strain behavior)
                 of a duplex heat treated Ti--6Al--4V alloy subjected to
                 a complex cyclic loading history. Representative
                 microstructures are simulated using a three-dimensional
                 finite element mesh with periodic boundary conditions
                 imposed in all directions. The measured orientation and
                 misorientation distributions of grains of this duplex
                 Ti--6Al--4V are considered, and similar probability
                 density distributions of the crystallographic
                 orientations are assigned to the finite element mesh.
                 The misorientation distributions are then fit using the
                 simulated annealing method. Effects of microstructural
                 features are examined and compared with the
                 experimental data in terms of their influence on the
                 material yield strength. The results are shown to be in
                 good agreement with the experimental observations.},

                 scale approaches through responses of polycrystals.
                 Intermediate forms of models vary from discrete (and
                 often dynamic) methods to statistical and continuum
                 methods. These range from coarse-grained atomistic and
                 microscopic phase field models, discrete dislocation
                 dynamics, dislocation field mechanics, statistical
                 continuum dislocation, and mesoscopic phase field
                 models to mesoscale generalized continuum models of
                 gradient or micropolar type and on up to grain-scale

                 crystalline plasticity are listed, and it is argued

                 related to previous hybrid models in which continuum
                 finite elements are coupled to a fully atomistic
                 region, with two key advantages: the ability to
                 accomodate discrete dislocations in the continuum
                 region and an algorithm for automatically detecting

                 single-crystal metal specimens of submicrometer size on
                 their dimensions. The emphasize is on the plasticity
                 mechanisms controlled by nucleation of dislocations in
                 the presence of free surfaces. We employed a dewetting
                 method to produce an ensemble of faceted,
                 single-crystal, defect-free gold nanoparticles on
                 sapphire substrates. Nanoindentation tests performed on
                 these particles reveal that their deformation
                 compliance increases with decreasing particle size,
                 i.e. as their lateral dimensions decrease. Gold thin
                 films of similar heights, which have no lateral free
                 surfaces, exhibited much higher resistance to plastic
                 deformation than the particles. To understand the role
                 played by lateral free surfaces on the strength of the
                 particles and thin films, we performed atomistic
                 molecular dynamic simulations of the indentation
                 process. The simulations showed that dislocations are
                 nucleated at the interface between the indenter and the
                 particles/films. These dislocations annihilated on the
                 lateral surfaces of the faceted particles, leading to
                 defect-free particles during indentation, while the
                 dislocations accumulated around and beneath the
                 indenter in the thin film, resulting in complex,
                 sessile dislocation structures. Particles elongated in
                 the lateral dimensions showed an intermediate
                 behaviour. The back-stress of the immobile dislocations
                 made the nucleation of new dislocations more difficult
                 and caused hardening both of the film and of the
                 elongated particles.},

                 dimensions can exhibit much higher strength than
                 macroscopic objects, but this strength rarely
                 approaches the maximum theoretical strength of the
                 material. Here, we demonstrate that faceted
                 single-crystalline nickel (Ni) nanoparticles exhibit an
                 ultrahigh compressive strength (up to 34 GPa)
                 unprecedented for metallic materials. This strength
                 matches the available estimates of Ni theoretical
                 strength. Three factors are responsible for this
                 record-high strength: the large Ni shear modulus, the
                 smooth edges and corners of the nanoparticles, and the
                 thin oxide layer on the particle surface. This finding
                 is supported by molecular dynamics simulations that
                 closely mimic the experimental conditions, which show
                 that the mechanical failure of the strongest particles
                 is triggered by homogeneous nucleation of dislocation
                 loops inside the particle. The nucleation of a stable
                 loop is preceded by multiple nucleation attempts
                 accompanied by unusually large local atomic
                 displacements caused by thermal fluctuations.},

                 develop intricate dislocation patterns such as the
                 labyrinth, mosaic, fence and carpet structures. In this
                 paper, such dislocation structures are given an
                 energetic interpretation with the aid of direct methods
                 of the calculus of variations. We formulate the theory
                 in terms of deformation fields and regard the
                 dislocations as manifestations of the incompatibility
                 of the plastic deformation gradient field. Within this
                 framework, we show that the incremental displacements
                 of inelastic solids follow as minimizers of a suitably
                 defined pseudoelastic energy function. In crystals
                 exhibiting latent hardening, the energy function is
                 nonconvex and has wells corresponding to single-slip
                 deformations. This favors microstructures consisting
                 locally of single slip. Deformation microstructures
                 constructed in accordance with this prescription are
                 shown to be in correspondence with several commonly
                 observed dislocation structures. Finally, we show that
                 a characteristic length scale can be built into the
                 theory by taking into account the self energy of the
                 dislocations. The extended theory leads to scaling laws
                 which appear to be in good qualitative and quantitative

                 components. The composition is twofold coupled to the

                 failure in defect-free graphene single crystals.
                 Elastic instabilities originate from softening in the
                 material response (decay of tangent moduli) induced by
                 dilatant mechanical deformation. Here, we characterize
                 the softening in the constitutive response of graphene
                 within the framework of hyperelasticity based on
                 symmetry-invariants of the two-dimensional logarithmic
                 strain tensor E (0). The use of symmetry-invariants
                 provides significant functional simplification in
                 representation of the strain energy function of
                 graphene; ab initio calculations of deformation energy
                 are well-fit using half the number of elastic constants
                 of previous formulations. For a set of large
                 homogeneous deformations comprising uniaxial
                 stretch/stress along the armchair and the zigzag
                 directions, and equi-biaxial tension, stress values
                 predicted by the model compare well with those directly
                 calculated from ab initio solutions. Using acoustic
                 tensor analysis, we show that the constitutive model

                 the modeling of their evolution is a complex task
                 because of the mechanisms involved such as plasticity,
                 recrystallization, and phase transformations, which are
                 common processes taking place in metallic alloys. This
                 complexity led to a growing interest in atomistic
                 simulations formulated without any auxiliary hypotheses
                 beyond the choice of interatomic potential. In this
                 context, we propose here a model based on an overdamped
                 stochastic evolution of particles interacting through
                 inter-atomic forces. The model settles to the correct

                 and nonlinear mechanics for large strains is
                 formulated. Analytical solutions for a stationary and
                 propagating single dislocation, dislocation velocity,
                 core energy, and core width are found. Dislocation
                 parameters for nickel are identified based on existing
                 molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast to all
                 previous efforts that are based on the spectral
                 approach, finite element method (FEM) is utilized,
                 which allowed us to treat large strain problems and
                 non-periodic boundary conditions. The single
                 dislocation order parameter profile and the stationary
                 distance between two neighboring dislocations at a
                 semicoherent sharp austenite--martensite interface are
                 in perfect agreement with analytical expressions. The
                 main focus is on proving that the new points of the
                 developed theory can be confirmed in simulations,
                 including possibility of obtaining the desired
                 dislocation height for aligned and inclined
                 dislocations, eliminating spurious stresses, resolving
                 dislocation cores and interaction between cores of
                 different dislocations. Mesh independence of the
                 solutions is demonstrated and the effect of
                 approximating finite element polynomials is analyzed,
                 exhibiting possibility of significant numerical errors
                 when special care is not taken of. Problems of

                 emerged as a powerful computational approach to
                 modeling and predicting mesoscale morphological and
                 microstructure evolution in materials. It describes a
                 microstructure using a set of conserved and
                 nonconserved field variables that are continuous across
                 the interfacial regions. The temporal and spatial
                 evolution of the field variables is governed by the
                 Cahn-Hilliard nonlinear diffusion equation and the
                 Allen-Cahn relaxation equation. With the fundamental
                 thermodynamic and kinetic information as the input, the
                 phase-field method is able to predict the evolution of
                 arbitrary morphologies and complex microstructures
                 without explicitly tracking the positions of

                 atoms induced by a dislocation can be approximated by a
                 continuum disregistry field. In this work, two
                 phase-field (PF)-based approaches and their variants
                 are employed to calculate the disregistry fields of
                 static, extended dislocations of pure edge and pure
                 screw character in two face-centred cubic metals: Au
                 and Al, which have distinct stable stacking fault
                 energy and elastic anisotropy. A new truncated Fourier
                 series form is developed to approximate the generalised
                 stacking fault energy (GSFE) surface, which shows
                 significant improvement over the previously employed
                 Fourier series form. By measuring the intrinsic
                 stacking fault (ISF) width and partial dislocation core
                 size in different ways, the PF-based disregistry fields
                 are quantitatively compared against those predicted by
                 molecular statics. In particular, two new measures for
                 the ISF widths are proposed and shown to overcome
                 drawbacks of the more commonly used standards in the
                 literature. Our calculations also show that continuum
                 formulation of the elastic energy and the GSFE for a
                 homogeneous surface can successfully characterise the
                 core structure. Last, our comparisons highlight the
                 significance of including the gradient energy in the
                 free energy formulation when an accurate description of
                 the dislocation core structure is desired.},

                 fundamental dynamic variables are the displacement
                 field u and the lattice velocity v=delta(u)/delta(t).
                 Damping is assumed to arise from the shear viscosity in
                 the momentum equation. The elastic energy density is a
                 periodic function of the shear and tetragonal strains,
                 which enables the formation of slips at large strains.
                 In this work we neglect defects such as vacancies,
                 interstitials, or grain boundaries. The simplest slip
                 consists of two edge dislocations with opposite Burgers
                 vectors. The formation energy of a slip is minimized if
                 its orientation is parallel or perpendicular to the
                 flow in simple shear deformation and if it makes angles
                 of +/-pi/4 with respect to the stretched direction in
                 uniaxial stretching. High-density dislocations produced
                 in plastic flow do not disappear even if the flow is
                 stopped. Thus large applied strains give rise to
                 structurally disordered states, which are metastable
                 due to the Peierls potential. We divide the elastic
                 energy into an elastic part due to affine deformation
                 and a defect part. The latter represents degree of
                 disorder and is nearly constant in plastic flow under

                 background; then dislocation mechanics based details
                 are developed in subsequent sections. Material

                 macroscopic and extending down to the critical
                 nanoscale. Controlling influences of temperature,
                 strain rate, grain size and deformation mode on strain

                 properties of grain size in the near-micrometer regime,
                 samples of Fe with nearly full density were prepared
                 using the spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique with
                 average grain sizes of 1.0 µm, 2.6 µm and 4.0 µm. In
                 each of these samples the resulting sintered material
                 was in a nearly fully-recrystallized condition with a
                 random texture. The mechanical properties of the
                 samples were examined via tensile testing. A strong
                 dependence of the tensile flow characteristics on the
                 average grain size was observed in this size regime,
                 with the 1.0 µm grain-size sample showing a very high
                 strength, but no uniform elongation and a large yield
                 drop developed in the 2.6 µm grain-size sample.
                 Analysis of the grain size dependence of yield strength
                 suggests a positive Hall-Petch deviation from the
                 expected grain boundary strengthening in the SPS Fe
                 samples, assuming a typical range of values for the
                 grain boundary strength (Hall-Petch coefficient).
                 Pre-compression of the 2.6 µm grain-size prior to
                 tensile testing sample results in a removal of the
                 yield drop and a corresponding large decrease in the
                 yield stress by as much as 145 MPa. The observations
                 suggest that the positive Hall-Petch deviation seen
                 previously in the near-micrometer regime for fully
                 recrystallized Al and Cu may also be present in Fe, and
                 highlight the likely importance of dislocation source
                 hardening in this grain size regime.},

                 focused on uniaxial compression experiments of single
                 crystals at the micrometer scale. Collectively, the
                 studies discovered new regimes of plastic flow that are
                 size-scale dependent and that occur in the absence of
                 strong strain gradients. However, the quantitative
                 comparison of the flow curves between independent
                 studies is hampered by differences in the particular
                 implementations of the testing methodology. Modeling of
                 microcompression experiments using 3-D discrete
                 dislocation simulations has provided valuable insight
                 into the mechanisms that control plastic flow in FCC
                 metals. These efforts identified the importance of the

                 the $\gamma$-surface) and elastic constants obtained
                 from the atomistic simulations. Being an energy-based
                 method, the MPF model lifts the degeneracy of the

                 provides an opportunity to explore and better
                 understand the elastic limit and incipient plasticity
                 in crystals. Homogeneous nucleation of a dislocation
                 beneath a nanoindenter is a strain localization event
                 triggered by elastic instability of the perfect crystal
                 at finite strain. The finite element calculation, with
                 a hyperelastic constitutive relation based on an
                 interatomic potential, is employed as an efficient
                 method to characterize such instability. This
                 implementation facilitates the study of dislocation
                 nucleation at length scales that are large compared to
                 atomic dimensions, while remaining faithful to the
                 nonlinear interatomic interactions. An instability
                 criterion based on bifurcation analysis is incorporated
                 into the finite element calculation to predict
                 homogeneous dislocation nucleation. This criterion is
                 superior to that based on the critical resolved shear
                 stress in terms of its accuracy of prediction for both
                 the nucleation site and the slip character of the
                 defect. Finite element calculations of nanoindentation
                 of single crystal copper by a cylindrical indenter and
                 predictions of dislocation nucleation are validated by
                 comparing with direct molecular dynamics simulations
                 governed by the same interatomic potential. Analytic 2D
                 and 3D linear elasticity solutions based on the Stroh
                 formalism are used to benchmark the finite element
                 results. The critical configuration of homogeneous
                 dislocation nucleation under a spherical indenter is
                 quantified with full 3D finite element calculations.
                 The prediction of the nucleation site and slip
                 character is verified by direct molecular dynamics
                 simulations. The critical stress state at the
                 nucleation site obtained from the interatomic potential

                 these particles display cataclysmic structural collapse
                 immediately following elastic loading to very high
                 stresses (over 1GPa), resulting in a nearly pristine
                 postmortem microstructure despite the large plastic
                 deformation experienced by the particle. This distinct
                 class of dislocation plasticity behavior is attributed
                 to the very high degree of structural perfection of the
                 initial sample, resulting from high-temperature
                 formation or annealing around the melting point.

	abstract = {Ordinarily, the strength and plasticity properties of
                 a metal are defined by dislocations-line defects in the
                 crystal lattice whose motion results in material
                 slippage along lattice planes. Dislocation dynamics
                 models are usually used as mesoscale proxies for true
                 atomistic dynamics, which are computationally expensive
                 to perform routinely. However, atomistic simulations
                 accurately capture every possible mechanism of material
                 response, resolving every ``jiggle and wiggle'' of
                 atomic motion, whereas dislocation dynamics models do
                 not. Here we present fully dynamic atomistic
                 simulations of bulk single-crystal plasticity in the
                 body-centred-cubic metal tantalum. Our goal is to
                 quantify the conditions under which the limits of
                 dislocation-mediated plasticity are reached and to
                 understand what happens to the metal beyond any such
                 limit. In our simulations, the metal is compressed at
                 ultrahigh strain rates along its [001] crystal axis
                 under conditions of constant pressure, temperature and
                 strain rate. To address the complexity of crystal
                 plasticity processes on the length scales (85-340 nm)
                 and timescales (1 ns-1$\mu$s) that we examine, we use
                 recently developed methods of in situ computational
                 microscopy to recast the enormous amount of transient
                 trajectory data generated in our simulations into a
                 form that can be analysed by a human. Our simulations
                 predict that, on reaching certain limiting conditions
                 of strain, dislocations alone can no longer relieve
                 mechanical loads; instead, another mechanism, known as
                 deformation twinning (the sudden re-orientation of the
                 crystal lattice), takes over as the dominant mode of
                 dynamic response. Below this limit, the metal assumes a
                 strain-path-independent steady state of plastic flow in
                 which the flow stress and the dislocation density
                 remain constant as long as the conditions of straining
                 thereafter remain unchanged. In this distinct state,
                 tantalum flows like a viscous fluid while retaining its
                 crystal lattice and remaining a strong and stiff

                 adaptively refining the mesh near lattice defects and
                 other highly energetic regions. The method differs from
                 conventional finite element analyses in that
                 interatomic interactions are incorporated into the
                 model through a crystal calculation based on the local
                 state of deformation. This procedure endows the model
                 with crucial properties, such as slip invariance, which
                 enable the emergence of dislocations and other lattice
                 defects. We assess the accuracy of the theory in the
                 atomistic limit by way of three examples: a stacking
                 fault on the (111) plane, and edge dislocations
                 residing on (111) and (100) planes of an aluminium
                 single crystal. The method correctly predicts the
                 splitting of the (111) edge dislocation into Shockley
                 partials. The computed separation of these partials is
                 consistent with results obtained by direct atomistic
                 simulations. The method predicts no splitting of the Al
                 Lomer dislocation, in keeping with observation and the
                 results of direct atomistic simulation. In both cases,
                 the core structures are found to be in good agreement
                 with direct lattice statics calculations, which attests
                 to the accuracy of the method at the atomistic scale.},

                 plasticity of single crystal Al during nanoindentation
                 on a (001) surface using a quasicontinuum method. The
                 results show that the presence of a nanocavity can
                 greatly affect the contact stiffness (Sc) and yield
                 stress ($\sigma$y) of the matrix during
                 nanoindentation. For a circular cavity, the Sc and
                 $\sigma$y gradually increase with the cavity depth. A
                 critical depth can be identified, over which the Sc and

                 firstly observed that the nucleated dislocations extend
                 into the matrix and form a y-shaped structure.
                 Moreover, the critical depth varies approximately
                 linearly with the indenter size, regarding the same
                 cavity. The Sc almost linearly decreases with the

                 between them, stresses may be relieved through
                 competing processes, such as slowly flowing water

                 deformation of polycrystalline materials. Recent
                 studies on the atomic structures of
                 [12\textasciimacron{}10] symmetrical tilt grain
                 boundaries (STGBs) in Mg and Ti showed that they can be
                 classified into six sets of STGBs, each set sharing
                 similar defect structures. Taking advantage of this and
                 using molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the
                 relationships between dislocation--STGB interactions.
                 We show that the outcome of the reactions can be
                 correlated with certain characteristics of the STGBs
                 and classified into three types: (1) for STGBs with low
                 misorientation angles, \{1\textasciimacron{}012\} twins
                 nucleate via the dissociation of grain boundary
                 dislocations (GBDs), (2) for STGBs with twin
                 orientations (twin boundaries, TB), lattice
                 dislocations dissociate into twinning dislocations
                 (TDs) enabling the TBs to migrate, and (3) for STGBs
                 that deviate from twin orientations, lattice
                 dislocations dissociate into TDs plus residual defects.
                 In the last case (3), the STGB can also migrate via the
                 glide of the TDs and climb of the intrinsic GBDs.
                 However, compared to case (2), boundary migration is
                 difficult because the intrinsic GBDs impede the motion
                 of the TDs. These correlations will significantly

                 plasticity, plastic deformation of crystalline solids
                 is, at least in the absence of so-called plastic
                 instabilities, envisaged as a smooth and quasi-laminar
                 flow process. Recent theoretical and experimental
                 investigations, however, demonstrate that crystal
                 plasticity is characterized by large intrinsic
                 spatio-temporal fluctuations with scale-invariant
                 characteristics: In time, deformation proceeds through
                 intermittent bursts with power-law size distributions;
                 in space, deformation patterns and deformation-induced
                 surface morphology are characterized by long-range
                 correlations, self-similarity and/or self-affine
                 roughness. We discuss this scale-invariant behaviour in
                 terms of robust scaling associated with a
                 non-equilibrium critical point (?yielding transition?).

                 ultraprecise nanoscale measurements on nickel

	abstract = {Serration and noise behaviors in plastically deforming
                 solids are related to avalanches of deformation
                 processes. In the stress-strain curves, the serration
                 characteristics are visible as stress drops or strain
                 jumps. In fact, similar serration characteristics are
                 ubiquitous in many structural and functional materials,
                 such as amorphous materials [also metallic glasses, or
                 bulk metallic glasses (BMGs)], high-entropy alloys
                 (HEAs), superalloys, ordered intermetallics,
                 shape-memory alloys (SMAs), electrochemical noise,
                 carbon steels, twinning-induced plasticity steels (TWIP
                 steels), phase-transformation-induced plasticity steels
                 (TRIP steels), Al-Mg alloys, nano-materials, magnetic
                 functional materials, and so on. Because of their
                 unique and universal properties, many researchers have
                 focused on this field to find out what causes the
                 serration behaviors and what can be learned about the
                 material from the serration characteristics. For
                 example, the serration characteristics contain
                 information about the mechanisms of plastic deformation
                 and the structural evolution during deformation.
                 However, due to many factors affecting the serration
                 behavior and some uncertain or uncontrolled factors,
                 it's a difficult task to give a unified picture of a
                 vast amount of serration data. This review article
                 summarizes the results of previous studies in this
                 rapidly-developing field, attempting to provide a new
                 perspective in expounding the connection between
                 macroscopic properties and micro-mechanisms. In this
                 review paper, serration behavior of a wide range of
                 materials will be discussed. One of the most important
                 goals is to investigate the factors influencing
                 serration characteristics and deformation mechanisms.
                 Several statistical properties, such as distributions
                 of stress drop sizes and waiting times, are reviewed
                 and used to quantify the serration behavior. Moreover,
                 models and theories on the serrated flow will be
                 discussed, which quantify the deformation mechanism and
                 provide physical intuition for the experiments, and
                 methods to organize experimental data. Besides
                 discussing serrations in stress-strain curves of many
                 solid materials, this review paper will also cover
                 other systems with serrations and collective noise,
                 such as crackling noise in the earth's crust
                 (earthquakes), volume fluctuations in a granular medium
                 and jamming behavior in random-packing systems.},

                 the elastic energy density is a periodic function of
                 the shear and tetragonal strains owing to the
                 underlying lattice structure. With this new ingredient,
                 solving the equations yields formation of dislocation
                 dipoles or slips. In plastic flow high-density
                 dislocations emerge at large strains to accumulate and
                 grow into shear bands where the strains are localized.
                 In addition to the elastic displacement, we also
                 introduce the local free volumem. For very smallm the
                 defect structures are metastable and long-lived where
                 the dislocations are pinned by the Peierls potential

                 eventually breaks the Peierls potential leading to slow
                 relaxations in the stress and the free energy (aging).

                 beneath the nanoindenter can achieve the theoretical
                 limit of a perfect crystal. The ensuing nonlinear
                 elastic instability can trigger homogenous dislocation
                 nucleation inside the crystal. Here we employ the
                 interatomic potential finite element method to simulate
                 nanoindentation and predict dislocation nucleation.
                 Simulations are performed for indentation on the (111),
                 (110) and (100) surfaces of Al, Cu, Ni single crystals.

                 properties are independent of sample size; however,
                 results of experiments and molecular dynamics
                 simulations indicate that crystals exhibit strong size
                 effects at the sub-micron scale. In experimental
                 studies, the size effect can be explained by strain
                 gradients. Atomistic simulations suggest that the yield
                 strength depends on the size even without strain
                 gradients and scales with the sample size through a
                 power relationship. We address these different
                 approaches to the size dependence of mechanical
                 properties. Results of uniaxial compression experiments

                 initial-boundary value problems of small scale
                 plasticity. Here we make qualitative, finite element
                 method-based computational predictions of the theory.
                 We demonstrate size effects and the development of
                 strong inhomogeneity in simple shearing of plastically
                 constrained grains. Non-locality in elastic straining
                 leading to a strong Bauschinger effect is analyzed. Low
                 shear strain boundary layers in constrained simple
                 shearing of infinite layers of polycrystalline
                 materials are not predicted by the model, and we
                 justify the result based on an examination of the
                 no-dislocation-flow boundary condition. The
                 time-dependent, spatially homogeneous, simple shearing
                 solution of PMFDM is studied numerically. The
                 computational results and an analysis of continuous
                 dependence with respect to initial data of solutions
                 for a model linear problem point to the need for a
                 nonlinear study of a stability transition of the
                 homogeneous solution with decreasing grain size and
                 increasing applied deformation. The
                 continuous-dependence analysis also points to a
                 possible mechanism for the development of spatial
                 inhomogeneity in the initial stages of deformation in
                 lower-order gradient plasticity theory. Results from

                 with results from discrete dislocation analyses are
                 noted where possible. We discuss the convergence of

                 that, mathematically, elasticity theory has much in
                 common with modern theories of thin elastic shells,
                 plates, or rods; static theories of liquid crystals;
                 and various other local theories associated with the
                 most common types of variational principles. This
                 chapter discusses that the interest in elasticity
                 theory lies in improving the theory underlying the
                 somewhat mystical process whereby definite forms of
                 constitutive equations are selected. The domain of
                 constitutive equations may include subdomains that are,
                 in principle, inaccessible to the experimentist. The
                 operationalist holds a contrary view. The chapter
                 highlights that the elasticity theory can predict the
                 effects that are not commonly thought of as being
                 associated with the adjective ``elastic.'' In such

                 directly visible. In such specimens, details of the

                 The plasticity of microsamples appears as a sequence of

                 glasses is rapidly developing with many applications. A
                 limitation is that under increasing external strain all
                 amorphous solids (like their crystalline counterparts)
                 have a finite yield stress which cannot be exceeded
                 without effecting a plastic response which typically
                 leads to mechanical failure. Understanding this is
                 crucial for assessing the risk of failure of glassy
                 materials under mechanical loads. Here we show that the
                 statistics of the energy barriers $\Delta$E that need

                 distribution function that goes smoothly to zero as
                 $\Delta$E=0 to a pdf which is finite at $\Delta$E=0 .

                 representation of f.c.c. crystalline materials has been
                 developed and implemented to investigate the
                 microstructural behaviour of f.c.c. crystalline
                 aggregates under inelastic deformations. The proposed
                 framework is based on coupling a multiple-slip crystal
                 plasticity formulation to three distinct dislocation
                 densities, which pertain to statistically stored
                 dislocations (SSDs), geometrically necessary
                 dislocations (GNDs) and grain boundary dislocations.
                 This interrelated dislocation density formulation is
                 then coupled to a specialized finite element framework
                 to study the evolving heterogeneous microstructure and
                 the localized phenomena that can contribute to failure
                 initiation as a function of inelastic crystalline
                 deformation. The GND densities are used to understand
                 where crystallographic, non-crystallographic and
                 cellular microstructures form and the nature of their
                 dislocation composition. The SSD densities are
                 formulated to represent dislocation cell
                 microstructures to obtain predictions related to the
                 inhomogeneous distribution of SSDs. The effects of the

                 the misfit dislocations at the GBs that accommodate

                 misfit dislocations, the strength of the boundary
                 regions can be more accurately represented to account
                 for phenomena associated with the effects of the GB

                 softening phenomena. Specifically, strain hardening is
                 described in terms of a Kocks?Mecking-type dislocation
                 density and the structural softening of irradiated
                 metals in terms of the density of irradiation-induced

                 specimens is characterized by intermittent sequences of
                 large strain bursts (dislocation avalanches) which are
                 separated by regions of near-elastic loading. In the
                 present investigation we perform a statistical
                 characterization of strain bursts observed in
                 stress-controlled compressive deformation of
                 monocrystalline molybdenum micropillars. We
                 characterize the bursts in terms of the associated
                 elongation increments and peak deformation rates, and
                 demonstrate that these quantities follow power-law
                 distributions that do not depend on specimen
                 orientation or stress rate. We also investigate the
                 statistics of stress increments in between the bursts,
                 which are found to be Weibull distributed and exhibit a
                 characteristic size effect. We discuss our findings in
                 view of observations of deformation bursts in other
                 materials, such as face-centred cubic and hexagonal
                 metals.},

                 crystalline materials in terms of the dynamics of
                 microscopic defects has been a goal of materials
                 research in the last 70 years. The size-dependent yield
                 stress observed in recent experiments of submicrometer
                 metallic pillars provides a unique opportunity to test
                 our theoretical models, allowing the predictions from
                 defect dynamics simulations to be directly compared
                 with mechanical strength measurements. Although
                 depletion of dislocations from submicrometer
                 face-centered-cubic (FCC) pillars provides a plausible
                 explanation of the observed size-effect, we predict
                 multiplication of dislocations in body-centered-cubic
                 (BCC) pillars through a series of molecular dynamics
                 and dislocation dynamics simulations. Under the
                 combined effects from the image stress and dislocation
                 core structure, a dislocation nucleated from the
                 surface of a BCC pillar generates one or more
                 dislocations moving in the opposite direction before it
                 exits from the surface. The process is repeatable so
                 that a single nucleation event is able to produce a
                 much larger amount of plastic deformation than that in
                 FCC pillars. This self-multiplication mechanism
                 suggests a need for a different explanation of the size
                 dependence of yield stress in FCC and BCC pillars.},

                 localized behavior that can endanger the structural
                 stability of a sample. Recent experiments revealed that
                 the mechanical response of a crystal is very sensitive
                 to both the presence of a quenched disorder in the
                 sample, and the orientation of the crystal. In this
                 work, we study the influence of disorder and crystal
                 orientation on the large 2-D plane strain response of a
                 FCC crystal with three active glide planes using a very
                 simple Eulerian plasticity model in the FE framework.
                 Our numerical and theoretical results on clean crystal
                 pillars suggest that a single plane or many gliding
                 planes can be activated depending on the crystal
                 orientation. While in the former case, the deformation
                 is localized, leading to ductile rupture, in the
                 latter, a complex interplay between active planes takes
                 place, resulting in a more uniform deformation. The
                 strain-localization can be avoided when inhomogeneities
                 are engineered inside the crystal, or the crystal
                 orientation is altered because of the activation of
                 multiple slip systems, resulting in a ''patchwork'' of

                 microstructural scale of the dislocation densities, of
                 various and complementary experimental data, and to
                 underline the excessive restriction introduced by the
                 classical assumption of pure strain hardening in the
                 determination of the most general single crystal
                 hardening variation law for the wider range of loading
                 processes. These developments about the microstructural
                 features of single crystal hardening, involving mobile
                 and nonmobile dislocation density evolutions

                 quantify the initial plastic deformation mechanisms of
                 gold as a model face-centered cubic (fcc) metal in the
                 nanoindentation process. The coupling effects of
                 crystallographic orientation and internal structural
                 defects on the resulting load distribution at the onset
                 of plasticity are investigated to clarify the
                 anisotropic characteristics of material responses to
                 crystallographic orientation. Homogenous defect
                 nucleation is studied by correlating the indentation
                 force-displacement curve with the instantaneous defect
                 structure. In the absence of pre-existing defects,
                 nanoindentation deformation is dominated by nucleation
                 of Shockley partial dislocations regardless of crystal
                 orientation. Various forms of dislocation propagation
                 are observed in different crystal orientations. The
                 elastic-plastic transition point appears later for the
                 [111]-oriented surface than the ones for [001]-, and
                 [011]-oriented surfaces. The relation of hardening and
                 dislocation density shows that conventional Taylor
                 hardening captures the plasticity after a certain
                 amount of indentation depth in the presence of enough
                 dislocation density. The crystal's sensitivity to the
                 presence of internal structural faults is strongly
                 dependent on the crystallographic orientation.
                 Nanoindentation simulations in the presence of sessile
                 dislocation loops in the structure show that the most
                 significant reduction in the pop-in load happens for
                 the [111] oriented sample. Our simulations suggest that
                 the indentation near a defect can lead to small,
                 subcritical events that lead to a smoother ``pop- in''
                 at the onset of plasticity. Since internal defects in
                 materials are nearly inevitable, a defect-based model
                 can be useful to understand the stochastic pop- in
                 loads in nanoindentation tests.},

                 hardening rate in stages III and IV is explored by
                 utilizing a fully described deformation microstructure.
                 Extensive measurements by transmission electron
                 microscopy reveal a hierarchical subdivision of grains
                 by low angle incidental dislocation boundaries (IDBs)
                 and medium to high angle geometrically necessary
                 boundaries (GNBs). This universal evolution is
                 demonstrated for nickel, copper, and aluminum deformed
                 by cold rolling from strains of 0.05--5.5.
                 Microstructural morphology evolves with increasing
                 strain through a transition resulting in a lamellar
                 cell-block structure aligned with the deformation. This
                 transition is caused by the emergence of new slip
                 systems and a stable texture. Four parameters describe
                 the microstructure, the misorientation angle across
                 each boundary type and their respective spacing.
                 Universal scaling characterizes the normalized
                 distributions of three separate parameters. A new
                 scaling law connects the strain evolution of two
                 strength parameters: the dislocation density of IDBs
                 and the spacing between GNBs. Strengthening mechanisms
                 and strength contributions for those two parameters are
                 expressed respectively as a linear addition of the
                 classical Taylor and Hall-Petch formulations. Model
                 predictions agree closely with experimental values of
                 flow stress and work hardening rate in stages III and
                 IV. Strong connections between the evolutionary stages
                 of the deformation microstructure and work hardening
                 rates create a new (modern) basis for the classic
                 problem of work hardening in metals and alloys. These

                 and developed by Tadmor, Ortiz and Phillips [1] in
                 1996, has since seen a great deal of development and
                 application by a number of researchers. The idea of the
                 method is a relatively simple one. With the goal of
                 modeling an atomistic system without explicitly
                 treating every atom in the problem, the QC provides a
                 framework whereby degrees of freedom are judiciously
                 eliminated and force/energy calculations are expedited.
                 This is combined with adaptive model refinement to
                 ensure that full atomistic detail is retained in
                 regions of the problem where it is required while
                 continuum assumptions reduce the computational demand
                 elsewhere. This article provides a review of the
                 method, from its original motivations and formulation
                 to recent improvements and developments. A summary of
                 the important mechanics of materials results that have
                 been obtained using the QC approach is presented.
                 Finally, several related modeling techniques from the
                 literature are briefly discussed. As an accompaniment
                 to this paper, a website designed to serve as a
                 clearinghouse for information on the QC method has been
                 established at www.qcmethod.com. The site includes

                 shown to be controlled by slow screw dislocation
                 motion, owing to the thermally-activated process of
                 kink pair nucleation and migration. Through three
                 dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics simulations,
                 this work unravels the mystery of how such slow screw
                 dislocation behavior contributes to extremely rapid
                 strain bursts in submicron BCC tungsten (W) pillars,
                 which is typical of BCC metals. It is found that strain
                 bursts are dominated by the motion of non-screw
                 dislocations at low strain rate, but are more
                 influenced by screw dislocations at high strain rate.
                 The total, and partial strain burst magnitude due to
                 screw dislocations alone, are found to exhibit rate
                 dependence following a power law statistics with
                 exponent of 0.65. Similar power law statistics are also
                 obeyed for the standard deviation of the corresponding
                 plastic strain rate. The role of screw dislocations is
                 attributed to the changing nature of dislocation source
                 operation at different strain rates. The corresponding
                 spatial distribution of plastic deformation is also

                 transformations can be described with three types of
                 matrix: the lattice distortion matrix, the orientation
                 relationship matrix and the correspondence matrix.
                 Given here are some formulae to express them in
                 crystallographic, orthonormal and reciprocal bases, and
                 an explanation is offered of how to deduce the matrices
                 of inverse transformation. In the case of the
                 hard-sphere assumption, a continuous form of distortion
                 matrix can be determined, and its derivative is
                 identified to the velocity gradient used in continuum
                 mechanics. The distortion, orientation and
                 correspondence variants are determined by coset
                 decomposition with intersection groups that depend on
                 the point groups of the phases and on the type of
                 transformation matrix. The stretch variants required in
                 the phenomenological theory of martensitic
                 transformation should be distinguished from the
                 correspondence variants. The orientation and
                 correspondence variants are also different; they are
                 defined from the geometric symmetries and algebraic
                 symmetries, respectively. The concept of orientation
                 (ir)reversibility during thermal cycling is briefly and
                 partially treated by generalizing the orientation
                 variants with n-cosets and graphs. Some simple examples
                 are given to show that there is no general relation
                 between the numbers of distortion, orientation and
                 correspondence variants, and to illustrate the concept
                 of orientation variants formed by thermal cycling.},

                 boundary migration and grain rotation in low angle
                 grain boundaries is studied through a combination of
                 molecular dynamics and phase field modeling. We have
                 performed two dimensional molecular dynamics
                 simulations on a bicrystal with a circular grain
                 embedded in a larger grain. Both size and orientation
                 of the embedded grain are observed to evolve with time.
                 The shrinking embedded grain is observed to have two
                 regimes: constant dislocation density on the grain
                 boundary followed by constant rate of increase in
                 dislocation density. Based on these observations from
                 the molecular dynamics simulations, a theoretical
                 formulation of the kinetics of coupled grain rotation
                 is developed. The grain rotation rate is derived for
                 the two regimes of constant dislocation density and
                 constant rate of change of dislocation density on the
                 grain boundary during evolution. The theoretical
                 calculation of the grain rotation rate shows strong
                 dependence on the grain size and compares very well
                 with the molecular dynamics simulations. A multi-order
                 parameter based phase field model with coupled grain
                 rotation is developed using the theoretical formulation

                 structure, is uniquely featured by its exotic
                 opto-electrical properties together with mechanical
                 robustness, thermal stability, and chemical inertness.
                 It is thus extensively studied for application in field
                 effect transistors (FETs), tunneling devices, deep UV
                 emitters and detectors, photoelectric devices, and
                 nanofillers. 2D-hBN is considered as one of the most
                 promising materials that can be integrated with other
                 2D materials, such as graphene and transition metal
                 dichalcogenides (TMDCs), for the next generation
                 microelectronic and other technologies. Although it is
                 by itself an insulator, it can well be tuned by several
                 strategies in terms of properties and functionalities,
                 such as by doping, substitution, functionalization and
                 hybridization, making 2D-hBN a truly versatile type of
                 functional materials for a wide range of applications.
                 In this review, the distinct structural characteristics
                 of 2D-hBN, doping- and defect-induced variations in
                 energy bands and structures, and resultant properties,
                 are presented. There are a wide variety of processing
                 routes that have been developed for 2D-hBN, including
                 also those for doping, substitution, functionalization
                 and combination with other materials to form
                 heterostructures or h-BNC hybrid nanosheets, which are
                 systematically elaborated for novel functions. The
                 comprehensive overview provides the types of the
                 state-of-the-art 2D-hBN made by new synthesis
                 strategies, where the mainstream approaches include

                 dynamics (PFDD). We begin by presenting recent
                 advancements made in modelling face-centred cubic
                 materials, such as integration with atomic-scale
                 simulations to account for partial dislocations. We
                 discuss calculations that help in understanding grain
                 size effects on transitions from full to partial
                 dislocation-mediated slip behaviour and deformation
                 twinning. Finally, we present recent extensions of the
                 PFDD framework to alternative crystal structures, such
                 as body-centred cubic metals, and two-phase materials,
                 including free surfaces, voids and bi-metallic
                 crystals. With several examples we demonstrate that the
                 PFDD model is a powerful and versatile method that can
                 bridge the length and time scales between atomistic and
                 continuum-scale methods, providing a much needed
                 understanding of deformation mechanisms in the
                 mesoscale regime.},

                 (fcc) metals, as revealed by uniaxial compression of
                 nanopillars, suggests that plasticity is dislocation
                 source-controlled, with fewer sources in smaller
                 pillars producing a ``smaller is stronger'' effect. To
                 further investigate this phenomenon we have studied the
                 effects of prestraining and annealing on the
                 deformation properties of [001] Au nanopillars. By
                 making pillars from an epitaxial film of [001] Au on
                 [001] MgO, using focused ion beam machining, we are
                 able to create both puck-shaped pillars that can be
                 stably prestrained and pillars with a high aspect
                 ratio, which can be tested in uniaxial compression. We
                 find that prestraining dramatically reduces the flow
                 strength of nanopillars while annealing restores the
                 strength to the pristine levels. These unusual effects
                 are not seen in bulk fcc metals, which behave in the
                 opposite way. We discuss their possible causes in terms

	abstract = {Plastic yielding of amorphous solids occurs by
                 power-law distributed deformation avalanches whose
                 universality is still debated. Experiments and
                 molecular dynamics simulations are hampered by limited
                 statistical samples, and although existing stochastic
                 models give precise exponents, they require strong
                 assumptions about fixed deformation directions, at odds
                 with the statistical isotropy of amorphous materials.
                 Here, we introduce a fully tensorial, stochastic
                 mesoscale model for amorphous plasticity that links the
                 statistical physics of plastic yielding to engineering
                 mechanics. It captures the complex shear patterning
                 observed for a wide variety of deformation modes, as
                 well as the avalanche dynamics of plastic flow.
                 Avalanches are described by universal size exponents
                 and scaling functions, avalanche shapes, and local
                 stability distributions, independent of system
                 dimensionality, boundary and loading conditions, and
                 stress state. Our predictions consistently differ from
                 those of mean-field depinning models, providing
                 evidence that plastic yielding is a distinct type of
                 critical phenomenon.},

                 potentials: Lennard-Jones, Morse, and Hookean springs.
                 The nucleation process is governed by the vanishing of
                 the energy associated with a single energy eigenmode.
                 The critical eigenmode, or dislocation embryo, is found
                 to be localized along a line (or plane in 3D) of atoms
                 with a lateral extent, $\xi$, at some depth, Y⁎,
                 below the surface. For all interatomic potentials, the
                 scaled critical load, Fc/R, and scaled critical contact
                 length, Cc/R, decrease to R-independent values in the
                 limit of large R. However, $\xi$/R and Y⁎/R display
                 non-trivial scaling with R despite the R independence
                 of Fc/R and Cc/R. We show that although both the
                 interaction potential and the orientation of the
                 lattice affect the prefactors in the scaling relations,
                 all the scaling laws are robust. Furthermore, we show

                 based on the minimum eigenvalue, $\Lambda$, of the

                 with a high degree of accuracy for all potentials and
                 crystallographic orientations. However, we also show
                 that, for all crystallographic orientations and

                 instability before the true instability occurs.},

                 instabilities in the athermal, quasistatic limit.
                 Microscopically these two types of glasses are as

                 In spite of this enormous difference the plastic

                 crystalline lattice to a tetragonal crystalline
                 lattice. The model is intended for simulating the
                 thermomechanical response of single-crystal grains of
                 austenite. Based on the geometrically nonlinear theory
                 of martensitic transformations, we incorporate
                 microstructural effects from several subgrain length
                 scales. The effective stiffness tensor at the grain
                 level is obtained through an averaging scheme, and
                 preserves crystallographic information from the lattice
                 scale as well as the influence of volumetric changes
                 due to the transformation. The model further
                 incorporates a transformation criterion that includes a
                 surface energy term, which takes into account the
                 creation of interfaces between martensite and
                 austenite. These effects, which are often neglected in
                 martensitic transformation models, thus appear
                 explicitly in the expression of the transformation
                 driving force that controls the onset and evolution of
                 the transformation. In the derivation of the

                 potentials and state variables. The predictions of the

                 to tetragonal transformations, it can be adapted to

	abstract = {In the last few decades, the phase field method has
                 shown tremendous capabilities of predicting
                 microstructure evolutions at the mesoscale scale. This
                 method was widely used for modeling martensitic phase
                 transformation, where the displacive character was a
                 challenging problem for the counterpart sharp interface
                 approach. Martensitic phase transformation, which is an
                 invariant plane stress twinning, drives a myriad of
                 phase transition phenomena of paramount importance to
                 many structural applications. This article provides a
                 literature review of the past phase field modeling
                 studies used to capture the formation and growth of

	abstract = {Acoustic emission originates during martensitic
                 transformations from sudden local changes of the
                 displacement field across the propagating interfaces.
                 Acoustic emission reveals the jerky character of the
                 dissipation of the elastic energy excess, which proves
                 that the transition occurs through avalanches. In this
                 paper we show that the analysis of acoustic emission
                 within an appropriate framework is a very useful
                 technique, which provides quantitative dynamical
                 information complementary to that obtained from more
                 standard techniques. In particular, we will show that
                 the probability density function of amplitudes,
                 energies and durations of the detected acoustic signals
                 follows power-law distributions related to avalanche
                 criticality. This is illustrated with examples for
                 non-magnetic and magnetic shape-memory alloys under
                 selected external conditions.},

                 a nonlinear elastic free-energy in terms of the
                 appropriate strain fields. The dynamics is simulated by
                 force balance equations for the displacement fields
                 with a damping term derived from a dissipation
                 function. Stress--strain properties in the
                 pseudoelastic as well as the shape memory regime are
                 investigated using strain loading. We also study the
                 effects of defect-induced heterogeneous nucleation and
                 motion of twin boundaries during deformation. Thus, we
                 probe the influence of the microstructure on the
                 mechanical response and investigate how the
                 stress--strain behavior changes as a function of strain
                 rate.},

                 quenched gamma phase (FCC) alloy Fe1-xPdx with x=0.28
                 and 0.37. The x=0.28 sample (crystal 2) exhibits a face
                 centred cubic to face centred tetragonal (FCC-FCT)
                 transition at Tm approximately 265K. The x=0.37 sample
                 (crystal 1) does not undergo a structural transition.
                 For both crystals the ( zeta zeta 0) TA1 phonon branch,
                 which corresponds to the elastic constant (C11-C12)/2,
                 decreases in energy around the Gamma point as the
                 magnetisation increases. The amount of softening of the
                 elastic constant, Delta (C11-C12)/2, of crystal 2 is
                 much larger than that of crystal 1 and has the same
                 temperature dependence as the square of the
                 magnetisation, M(T)2. The temperature dependence of
                 (C11-C12)/2 implies that this phonon softening is the
                 cause of the FCC-FCT transition. The other branches
                 display very little if any anomalous behaviour. A large

                 martensitic phase transformations are desirable for
                 applications in medical sensors and actuators,
                 eco-friendly refrigerators and energy conversion
                 devices. The ability to pass back and forth through the
                 phase transformation many times without degradation of
                 properties (termed 'reversibility') is critical for
                 these applications. Materials tuned to satisfy a
                 certain geometric compatibility condition have been
                 shown to exhibit high reversibility, measured by low
                 hysteresis and small migration of transformation
                 temperature under cycling. Recently, stronger
                 compatibility conditions called the 'cofactor
                 conditions' have been proposed theoretically to achieve
                 even better reversibility. Here we report the enhanced
                 reversibility and unusual microstructure of the first
                 martensitic material, Zn45Au30Cu25, that closely
                 satisfies the cofactor conditions. We observe four
                 striking properties of this material. (1) Despite a
                 transformation strain of 8\%, the transformation
                 temperature shifts less than 0.5 $\,^{\circ}$C after
                 more than 16,000 thermal cycles. For comparison, the
                 transformation temperature of the ubiquitous NiTi alloy
                 shifts up to 20 $\,^{\circ}$C in the first 20 cycles.
                 (2) The hysteresis remains approximately 2
                 $\,^{\circ}$C during this cycling. For comparison, the
                 hysteresis of the NiTi alloy is up to 70 $\,^{\circ}$C
                 (refs 9, 12). (3) The alloy exhibits an unusual
                 riverine microstructure of martensite not seen in other
                 martensites. (4) Unlike that of typical polycrystal
                 martensites, its microstructure changes drastically in
                 consecutive transformation cycles, whereas macroscopic
                 properties such as transformation temperature and
                 latent heat are nearly reproducible. These results
                 promise a concrete strategy for seeking ultra-reliable
                 martensitic materials.},

                 description of stochastic domain wall dynamics in soft
                 magnetic materials are reviewed. The intrinsically
                 random nature of domain wall motion results in the
                 Barkhausen effect, which exibits scaling properties at
                 low magnetization rates and 1/f power spectra. It is
                 shown that the Barkhausen signal ν, as well as the
                 size Δx and the duration Δu of jumps follow
                 distributions of the form ν−α, Δx−β, Δu−γ,
                 with α=1−c, β=3/2−c/2, γ=2--c, where c is a
                 dimensionless parameter proportional to the applied
                 field rate. These results are analytically calculated
                 by means of a stochastic differential equation for the
                 domain wall dynamics in a random perturbed medium with
                 brownian properties and then compared to experiments.
                 The Barkhausen signal is found to be related to a
                 random Cantor dust with fractal dimension D=1−c, from
                 which the scaling exponents are calculated using simple
                 properties of fractal geometry. Fractal dimension Δ of
                 the signal v is also studied using four different
                 methods of calculation, giving Δ≈1.5, independent of

@article{Carlson1991-jh,
	abstract = {We present a detailed numerical study of certain
                 fundamental aspects of a one-dimensional homogeneous,
                 deterministic Burridge-Knopoff model. The model is
                 described by a massive wave equation, in which the key
                 nonlinearity is associated with the stick-slip
                 velocity-weakening friction force at the interface
                 between tectonic plates. In this paper, we present
                 results for the statistical distribution of slipping
                 events in the limit of a very long fault and
                 infinitesimally slow driving rates. Typically, we find
                 that the magnitude distribution of smaller events is
                 consistent with the Gutenberg-Richter law, while the
                 larger events occur in excess of this distribution. The
                 crossover from smaller to larger events is identified
                 with a correlation length describing the transition
                 from localized to delocalized events. We also find that
                 there is a sharp upper cutoff describing the maximum
                 large event. We identify how the correlation length and
                 this upper cutoff scale with the parameters in the
                 model. We find that both are independent of system
                 size, while both do depend on the spatial
                 discretization. In addition to the magnitude
                 distribution, we present a series of measurements of
                 other seismologically relevant quantities, including
                 the event duration, the size of the rupture zone, and
                 the energy release, and discuss the relationship
                 between our measurements and the corresponding
                 empirical laws in seismology.},

@article{Truskinovsky2005-tq,
	abstract = {Martensitic phase transitions are often modeled by
                 mixed-type hyperbolic-elliptic systems. Such systems
                 lead to ill-posed initial-value problems unless they
                 are supplemented by an additional kinetic relation. In
                 this paper we explicitly compute an appropriate closing
                 relation by replacing the continuum model with its
                 natural discrete prototype. The procedure can be viewed
                 as either regularization by discretization or a
                 physically motivated account of underlying discrete
                 microstructure. We model phase boundaries by traveling
                 wave solutions of a fully inertial discrete model for a
                 bi-stable lattice with harmonic long-range
                 interactions. Although the microscopic model is
                 Hamiltonian, it generates macroscopic dissipation which
                 can be specified in the form of a relation between the
                 velocity of the discontinuity and the conjugate
                 configurational force. This kinetic relation respects
                 entropy inequality but is not a consequence of the
                 usual Rankine--Hugoniot jump conditions. According to
                 the constructed solution, the dissipation at the
                 macrolevel is due to the induced radiation of lattice
                 waves carrying energy away from the propagating front.
                 We show that sufficiently strong nonlocality of the
                 lattice model may be responsible for the
                 multivaluedness of the kinetic relation and can
                 quantitatively affect kinetics in the near-sonic
                 region. Direct numerical simulations of the transient
                 dynamics suggest stability of at least some of the
                 computed traveling waves.},

	abstract = {Sound-velocity measurements in V3Si have shown that
                 the modulus (C11-C12)/2 for [110] shear waves with
                 [11¯0] polarization falls from a value at room
                 temperature typical of the metallic state to near-zero
                 magnitude in the superconducting state, while the bulk
                 modulus (C11+2C12)/3 is constant to 0.5\% in the same
                 temperature interval. The attenuation of the soft shear
                 mode increases markedly on cooling. A large increase in
                 attenuation for all modes occurs with the structural
                 transformation at 21$\,^{\circ}$K reported by Batterman
                 and Barrett. The transformation, triggered by the small
                 shear stiffness, is arrested with the onset of the
                 superconducting state. The distortions of the
                 structural transformation are found to be comparable in
                 magnitude with the thermal strains resulting from the
                 soft shear mode. The behavior of the high-frequency
                 phonons involved in the superconductivity is not known,
                 although the specific-heat and electrical-resistivity
                 data indicate that they may be stiffer than the
                 near-liquidlike low-frequency phonons. The lattice
                 instability may result from a very strain-sensitive
                 structure in the density-of-states distribution near
                 the Fermi level. The unusual elastic behavior reported
                 here for V3Si is probably characteristic of most
                 high-temperature superconductors.},

@article{Beke2018-xv,
	abstract = {Differential Scanning Calorimetric, DSC, runs taken
                 during martensitic phase transformations in shape
                 memory alloys, often look differently during cooling
                 and heating. Similar asymmetry is observed e.g. for the
                 numbers of hits or the critical exponents of energy and
                 amplitude distributions (ε and α, respectively) in
                 acoustic emission measurements. It is illustrated that,
                 in accordance with empirical correlations, the above
                 asymmetry of acoustic noises can be classified into two
                 groups: the relative changes of the exponents during
                 cooling and heating (γε=(εh-εc)/εc as well as
                 γα=(αh-αc)/αc)) are either positive or negative.
                 For positive γ values the number of hits and the total
                 energy of acoustic emission are larger for cooling, and
                 the situation is just the reverse for negative
                 asymmetry. Our interpretation is based on the different
                 ways of relaxation of the elastic strain energy during
                 cooling as well as heating. It is illustrated that if
                 the relaxed fraction of the total elastic strain energy
                 (which would be stored without relaxations) during
                 cooling is larger than the corresponding relaxed
                 fraction during heating, then the asymmetry is
                 positive. Magnetic emission noises, accompanied with
                 martensitic phase transformations in ferromagnetic
                 alloys, show similar asymmetry than those observed for
                 thermal (DSC) and acoustic noises and depends on the
                 constant external magnetic field too.},

@article{West1989-gr,
	abstract = {A generic mechanism for the ubiquitous phenomenon of
                 1/f noise is reviewed. This mechanism arises in random
                 processes expressible as a product of several random
                 variables. Under mild conditions this product form
                 leads to the log-normal distribution which we show
                 straightforwardly generates 1/f noise. Thus, 1/f noise
                 is tied directly to a probability limit distribution. A
                 second mechanism involving scaling is introduced to
                 provide a natural crossover from log-normal to inverse
                 power-law behavior and generates 1/fα noise instead of
                 pure 1/f noise. Examples of these distributions and the
                 transitions between them are drawn from such diverse
                 areas as economics, scientific productivity, bronchial
                 structure and cardiac activity.},

                 microelasticity modeling and simulations. It is shown
                 that the decomposition in such a system is not
                 necessarily developed by conventional nucleation and
                 growth of the tetragonal phase. There are three
                 temperature and composition ranges where the sequences

                 transformation pathways are predicted and the
                 corresponding thermodynamic parameters are identified.
                 In particular, the simulations reveal unusual

                 involving equipartition which suggests thermalization.

                 elasticity problem for the material with an arbitrary
                 phase pattern in the homogeneous and isotropic modulus
                 approximation. The transformation-induced coherency
                 strain, strain coupling between grains, and applied
                 stress are explicitly taken into account in this
                 solution. Computer simulations are performed for the
                 martensitic transformation with crystallographic
                 parameters corresponding to the transformation in Fe-31
                 at.\% Ni alloy. The polycrystalline systems with a
                 periodically repeated motif of three, five and seven
                 grains of the parent phase with different orientations
                 are studied. The development of the martensitic
                 transformation through nucleation, growth and
                 coarsening of orientation variants is simulated at
                 different levels of the applied stress. The simulated
                 martensitic structure has a complex polytwinned
                 morphology. The simulation has shown that the
                 martensitic transformation in polycrystals drastically
                 differs from the transformation in single crystals. The
                 simulation has predicted that the deformation curve of
                 a polycrystalline material has a hysteretic effect.},

                 electron microscopy and the selected area diffraction.
                 It was observed that the tweed contrast consisting of
                 {011}/ striations and accompanying the diffuse streaks
                 became distinct from a temperature nearly 100 K above
                 the Ms with lowering temperature. The tweed contrast
                 was found to be induced by the static displacement of
                 atoms, δ{011}/[01{\=\i}], associated with the
                 formation of disc-shaped martensite nuclei on the {110}

                 persistently remained in the fct martensite in the
                 early stage of the transformation, where the degree of
                 tetragonality is small and the c-axis directions of the
                 small fct martensite variants are tilted against each
                 other, giving rise to the tweed pattern. A similar
                 tweed contrast observed in the initial stage of
                 ordering in a stoichiometric Fe-Pd alloy was also
                 explained by a strain contrast effect arising from an
                 elastic shear strain induced by the nucleation of short

                 the study of the mechanics and mathematics of
                 crystalline solids over the past 35 years.It presents a
                 splendid corpus of research papers that cover areas on
                 crystal symmetry, constitutive equations, defects and
                 phase transitions --- all topics of current importance
                 to a broad group of workers in the field.The volume
                 thus provides in one place material that is frequently
                 referenced by numerous researchers on crystals across a
                 spectrum of activities in areas of continuum mechanics,
                 applied mathematics, engineering and materials
                 science.Each group of papers or chapters in the book is
                 preceded by a summary introduction that describes how
                 the papers on that topic fit together, and in which
                 Ericksen sketches the context of each paper and shares
                 with the reader his thinking and insightfulness in
                 writing it. The volume, edited by internationally
                 renowned scholars whose works in finite elasticity and
                 continuum mechanics have appeared in a variety of books
                 and prestigious journals published over the past four
                 decades, also includes a very interesting brief
                 autobiography by Ericksen. In it he describes his early
                 life in Oregon, his wartime experiences, his student
                 days and postgraduate study, his introduction to
                 scientific work, and what motivated him in his
                 research. An English translation and revision of the

	abstract = {In this paper we report recent progress in large?scale
                 atomistic studies of crack propagation along interfaces
                 of dissimilar materials. We consider two linear?elastic
                 material blocks bound together with a weak potential
                 whose bonds snap early upon a critical atomic
                 separation. This approach confines crack motion along
                 the interface. In the two blocks, atoms interact with
                 harmonic potentials with different spring constants
                 adjacent to the interface. An initial crack is
                 introduced along the interface and subjected to shear
                 dominated displacement loading along the upper and
                 lower boundaries of the sample. Upon initiation of the
                 crack, we observe that it quickly approaches a velocity
                 close to the Rayleigh?wave speed of the soft material.
                 After cruising at this speed for some time, a secondary
                 crack is nucleated at a few atomic spacings ahead of
                 the crack. This secondary crack, also referred to as
                 the daughter crack, propagates at the longitudinal?wave
                 speed of the soft material. Shortly after that, a
                 tertiary crack, referred to as the granddaughter crack,
                 is nucleated and begins to move at the longitudinal
                 wave speed of the stiff material. The granddaughter
                 crack is supersonic with respect to the soft material
                 and is clearly identifiable by two Mach cones in the
                 soft material. Our results indicate that the limiting
                 speed of shear dominated cracks along a bi?material
                 interface is the longitudinal wave speed of the stiff
                 material, and that there are two intermediate limiting
                 speeds (Rayleigh and longitudinal wave speeds of the
                 soft material) which can be overcome by the
                 mother?daughter?granddaughter mechanism.},

                 that include higher order deformation gradients. These
                 models incorporate a length scale for the localized
                 deformation zone and are either postulated or justified
                 from micromechanical considerations. Of interest here
                 is the consistent derivation of such models from a
                 given microstructure and the subsequent investigation
                 of their localization and stability behavior under
                 finite strains. In the interest of simplicity, the
                 microscopic model is a discrete, periodic, non-linear
                 elastic lattice structure in two or three dimensions.
                 The corresponding macroscopic model is a continuum
                 constitutive law involving displacement gradients of
                 all orders. Attention is focused on the simplest such
                 model, namely the one whose energy density includes
                 gradients of the displacements only up to the second
                 order. The relation between the ellipticity of the
                 resulting first (local) and second (non-local) order
                 gradient models at finite strains, the stability of
                 uniform strain solutions and the possibility of
                 localized deformation zones is discussed. The
                 investigations of the resulting continuum are done for
                 two different microstructures, the second one of which
                 approximates the behavior of perfect monatomic crystals
                 in plane strain. Localized strain solutions based on
                 the continuum approximation are possible with the first
                 microstructurc but not with the second. Implications
                 for the stability of three-dimensional crystals using
                 realistic interaction potentials are also discussed.},

                 with periodic microstructures. Using a multiple scales
                 asymptotic technique, we express the critical load at
                 the onset of the first instability and the
                 corresponding eigenmode in terms of the scale size
                 parameter $\epsilon$. The zeroth order $\epsilon$ terms
                 in these expansions depend on the standard (first order
                 gradient) macroscopic moduli tensor, while all the
                 higher order $\epsilon$ terms require the determination
                 of higher order gradient macroscopic moduli. These
                 macroscopic moduli, which are calculated by solving
                 appropriate boundary value problems on the unit cell,
                 relate the macroscopic (unit cell average) stress rate
                 increment to the macroscopic displacement rate
                 gradients. The proposed general theory is subsequently
                 applied to the investigation of the failure surfaces in
                 periodic solids of infinite extent. For these solids
                 one can define in macroscopic strain space a
                 microscopic (local) failure surface, which corresponds
                 to the onset of the first bulking-type instability in
                 the solid, and a macroscopic (global) failure surface,
                 which corresponds to the onset of the first long
                 wavelength instability in the solid. The determination
                 of the macrofailure surface is considerably easier than
                 the determination of the microfailure surface, for it
                 requires the calculation of the standard macroscopic
                 moduli tensor. In addition, the regions where the two
                 surfaces coincide is of significant practical interest,
                 for a macroscopic localized mode of deformation (e.g.
                 in the form of a shear band or a kink band) appears in
                 the post-bifurcation regime. The prediction of these
                 coincidence zones is based on a necessary criterion
                 that depends on the higher order gradient macroscopic
                 moduli. A detailed example is given for the case of
                 layered composites, in view of the possibility of
                 obtaining closed form expressions for all the required
                 macroscopic moduli and in view of the existence of an
                 analytical solution to the microscopic failure problem.
                 Two applications are presented, one for a foam rubber
                 composite and another for a graphite-epoxy composite
                 whose properties have been determined experimentally.
                 Following the verification of the above mentioned

                 addressing this issue, we presently obtain, based on
                 the molecular level information, a derivative-free
                 balance law pertaining to a higher scale of interest
                 and useful in a continuum or discrete setting. Derived
                 using a probabilistic projection technique, the law
                 exploits certain microstructural information in a
                 weakly unique manner. The projection generalizes the
                 notion of directional derivative and, depending on the
                 application, may be interpreted as a discrete
                 Cauchy--Born map with the structure of the classical
                 deformation gradient emerging in the infinitesimal
                 limit. As an illustration, we use the Tersoff--Brenner
                 potential and obtain a discrete macroscopic model for
                 studying the deformation of a single-walled carbon

                 branching phenomena in agreement with molecular
                 dynamics simulations. As another example, we have

                 and to examine the structure of groups that act
                 properly on such spaces by isometries. Thus the central
                 objects of study are metric spaces in which every pair
                 of points can be joined by an arc isometric to a
                 compact interval of the real line and in which every
                 triangle satisfies the CAT(O) inequality. This
                 inequality encapsulates the concept of non-positive
                 curvature in Riemannian geometry and allows one to
                 reflect the same concept faithfully in a much wider
                 setting - that of geodesic metric spaces. Because the

	abstract = {Lattice reduction is a geometric generalization of the
                 problem of computing greatest common divisors. Most of
                 the interesting algorithmic problems related to lattice
                 reduction are NP-hard as the lattice dimension
                 increases. This article deals with the low-dimensional
                 case. We study a greedy lattice basis reduction
                 algorithm for the Euclidean norm, which is arguably the
                 most natural lattice basis reduction algorithm because
                 it is a straightforward generalization of an old
                 two-dimensional algorithm of Lagrange, usually known as
                 Gauss' algorithm, and which is very similar to Euclid's
                 gcd algorithm. Our results are twofold. From a
                 mathematical point of view, we show that up to
                 dimension four, the output of the greedy algorithm is
                 optimal: The output basis reaches all the successive
                 minima of the lattice. However, as soon as the lattice
                 dimension is strictly higher than four, the output
                 basis may be arbitrarily bad as it may not even reach
                 the first minimum. More importantly, from a
                 computational point of view, we show that up to
                 dimension four, the bit-complexity of the greedy
                 algorithm is quadratic without fast integer arithmetic,
                 just like Euclid's gcd algorithm. This was already
                 proved by Semaev up to dimension three using rather
                 technical means, but it was previously unknown whether
                 or not the algorithm was still polynomial in dimension
                 four. We propose two different analyzes: a global
                 approach based on the geometry of the current basis
                 when the length decrease stalls, and a local approach
                 showing directly that a significant length decrease
                 must occur every O(1) consecutive steps. Our analyzes
                 simplify Semaev's analysis in dimensions two and three,
                 and unify the cases of dimensions two to four. Although
                 the global approach is much simpler, we also present
                 the local approach because it gives further information
                 on the behavior of the algorithm.},

                 microstructure evolution in BCC crytals under
                 high-strain rate conditions. These are traced to
                 unexpected behaviors of dislocation network nodes
                 forming at dislocation intersections, that can move in
                 ways not previously anticipated as revealed by MD. Once
                 these newfound freedoms of nodal motion are
                 incorporated, DDD simulations begin to closely match
                 plastic evolution observed in MD. This additional
                 mechanism of motion whereby non-screw dislocations can
                 change their glide plane profoundly affects fundamental
                 processes of dislocation multiplication, recovery and
                 storage that define strength of metals.},

                 simple uniform field two-phase model. Both models
                 combine isotropic Drucker--Prager elastic--plastic

                 elastic--plastic behavior of the binder, and include
                 non-linear hardening. We performed simulations for
                 representative volume elements using the generalized
                 2.5D formulation and demonstrated a good agreement
                 between the two models in terms of the effective
                 mechanical behavior. Effective elastic properties and
                 coefficients of thermal expansion were obtained.
                 Effective yield stresses evaluated at 0.1\% of
                 effective plastic strain were also computed for six
                 different loading paths. Probability and joint
                 probability histograms obtained in FE simulations are
                 presented. We also studied the effect of residual
                 thermal stresses, which appear in WC hardmetals due to
                 cooling from sintering temperatures. Finally, we
                 obtained a realistic yield surface for a

                 initially flawless soft elastic solids is preceded by a
                 continuum instability which cannot be captured without
                 accounting for geometrically and physical
                 nonlinearities of the constitutive response. To
                 corroborate this somewhat counterintuitive claim, we
                 present a theoretical and numerical study of the
                 simplest model where a homogeneous elastic body
                 subjected to tension is weakened by a free surface
                 which then serves as a site of crack nucleation. We
                 show that in this prototypical setting, brittle
                 fracture starts as a symmetry breaking elastic
                 instability activated by softening and involving large
                 elastic rotations. The implied bifurcation of the
                 homogeneous elastic equilibrium is highly
                 unconventional due to its extraordinary sensitivity to
                 geometry, reminiscent of the transition to turbulence.
                 We trace the development of the instability beyond the
                 limits of continuum elasticity by using quasi-continuum
                 theory allowing one to capture the ultimate strain

                 surface scratches on the mechanical strength of solids,
                 some general conclusions were reached which appear to
                 have a direct bearing on the problem of rupture, from
                 an engineering standpoint, and also on the larger
                 question of the nature of intermolecular cohesion. The
                 original object of the work, which was carried out at
                 the Royal Aircraft Estab-lishment, was the discovery of
                 the effect of surface treatment---such as, for
                 instance, filing, grinding or polishing---on the
                 strength of metallic machine parts subjected to
                 alternating or repeated loads. In the case of steel,
                 and some other metals in common use, the results of
                 fatigue tests indicated that the range of alternating
                 stress which could be permanently sustained by the
                 material was smaller than the range within which it was
                 sensibly elastic, after being subjected to a great
                 number of reversals. Hence it was inferred that the
                 safe range of loading of a part, having a scratched or
                 grooved surface of a given type, should be capable of
                 estimation with the help of one of the two hypotheses
                 of rupture commonly used for solids which are elastic
                 to fracture. According to these hypotheses rupture may
                 be expected if (a) the maximum tensile stress, (b) the
                 maximum extension, exceeds a certain critical value.
                 Moreover, as the behaviour of the materials under
                 consideration, within the safe range of alternating
                 stress, shows very little departure from Hooke's law,
                 it was thought that the necessary stress and strain
                 calculations could be performed by means of the
                 mathematical theory of elasticity.},

	abstract = {The computational modeling of failure mechanisms in
                 solids due to fracture based on sharp crack
                 discontinuities suffers in situations with complex
                 crack topologies. This can be overcome by a diffusive
                 crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack
                 phase field. Following our recent work [C. Miehe, F.
                 Welschinger, M. Hofacker, Thermodynamically-consistent
                 phase field models of fracture: Variational principles

                 DOI:10.1002/nme.2861] on phase-field-type fracture, we
                 propose in this paper a new variational framework for
                 rate-independent diffusive fracture that bases on the
                 introduction of a local history field. It contains a
                 maximum reference energy obtained in the deformation
                 history, which may be considered as a measure for the
                 maximum tensile strain obtained in history. It is shown
                 that this local variable drives the evolution of the
                 crack phase field. The introduction of the history
                 field provides a very transparent representation of the
                 balance equation that governs the diffusive crack
                 topology. In particular, it allows for the construction
                 of a new algorithmic treatment of diffusive fracture.
                 Here, we propose an extremely robust operator split
                 scheme that successively updates in a typical time step
                 the history field, the crack phase field and finally
                 the displacement field. A regularization based on a
                 viscous crack resistance that even enhances the
                 robustness of the algorithm may easily be added. The
                 proposed algorithm is considered to be the canonically
                 simple scheme for the treatment of diffusive fracture
                 in elastic solids. We demonstrate the performance of
                 the phase field formulation of fracture by means of

                 problems relevant to the cracking of a thin film bonded
                 to a dissimilar semi-infinite substrate material. The
                 first problem is that of a crack in the film oriented
                 perpendicular to the film/substrate interface with the
                 crack tip touching the interface. The second problem is
                 that of a crack of the same geometry, but with length
                 less than the film thickness, so that the crack tip is
                 within the film. These problems are used to model
                 several modes of crack extension in thin films bonded

                 performed on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films
                 coated with a 100 nm thin silicon oxide layer. The
                 coating's fragmentation process was analyzed in light
                 of the mechanical behavior of the polymer substrate. It
                 was shown that, upon unloading samples strained to less
                 than 4\% nominal strain, strain recovery leads to the
                 closure of coating cracks. The usual fragmentation
                 diagram, which shows the crack density (CD) versus
                 applied strain, was used to identify the various energy
                 dissipation mechanisms controlling the fragmentation
                 process. An alternative presentation of CD versus true
                 stress provided accurate measurements of both
                 fragmentation and saturation onsets. The interfacial
                 strength was modeled from the CD at saturation
                 according to the Kelly-Tyson approach, including a
                 Weibull distribution of the coating strength. The
                 prediction was compared to the substrate shear stress
                 at saturation. Effects of substrate yield, temperature,
                 and molecular orientation are discussed. It was shown
                 that the coating deposition by evaporation on the PET
                 substrate did not induce structural changes at the
                 polymer interface, whereas heat treatments increased
                 the polymer crystallinity in the interfacial zone,
                 resulting in higher interfacial strength. ? 1997 John

                 with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir
                 (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and

                 schemes for phase field fracture modelling. Several
                 paradigmatic boundary value problems are addressed,
                 spanning the fields of quasi-static fracture, fatigue
                 damage and dynamic cracking. The finite element results
                 obtained reveal the robustness of quasi-Newton
                 monolithic schemes, with convergence readily attained
                 under both stable and unstable cracking conditions.
                 Moreover, since the solution method is unconditionally
                 stable, very significant computational gains are
                 observed relative to the widely used staggered solution
                 schemes. In addition, a new adaptive time increment
                 scheme is presented to further reduce the computational
                 cost while allowing to accurately resolve sudden
                 changes in material behavior, such as unstable crack
                 growth. Computation times can be reduced by several
                 orders of magnitude, with the number of load increments
                 required by the corresponding staggered solution being
                 up to 3000 times higher. Quasi-Newton monolithic

@article{Wu2020-qk,
	abstract = {Despite the popularity in modeling complex and
                 arbitrary crack configurations in solids, phase-field
                 damage models suffer from burdensome computational
                 cost. This issue arises largely due to the robust but
                 inefficient alternating minimization (AM) or staggered
                 algorithm usually employed to solve the coupled
                 damage--displacement governing equations. Aiming to
                 tackle this difficulty, we propose in this work, for
                 the first time, to use the
                 Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno (BFGS) algorithm to
                 solve in a monolithic manner the system of coupled
                 governing equations, rather than the standard Newton
                 one which is notoriously poor for problems involving
                 non-convex energy functional. It is found that, the
                 BFGS algorithm yields identical results to the
                 AM/staggered solver, and is also robust for both
                 brittle fracture and quasi-brittle failure with a
                 single or multiple cracks. However, much less
                 iterations are needed to achieve convergence.
                 Furthermore, as the system matrix is less reformed per
                 increment, the quasi-Newton monolithic algorithm is
                 much more efficient than the AM/staggered solver.
                 Representative numerical examples show that the saving
                 in CPU time is about factor 3∼7, and the larger the
                 problem is, the more saving it gains. As the BFGS
                 monolithic algorithm has been incorporated in many
                 commercial software packages, it can be easily
                 implemented and is thus attractive in the phase-field

                 number of homogeneous and inhomogeneous material
                 systems. The models are typically expressed as a
                 function of normal and tangential tractions in terms of
                 separation distances. The forms of the functions and
                 parameters vary from model to model. In this work, two
                 different forms of CZMs (exponential and bilinear) are
                 used to evaluate the response of interfaces in titanium
                 matrix composites reinforced by silicon carbide (SCS-6)
                 fibers. The computational results are then compared to
                 thin slice push-out experimental data. It is observed
                 that the bilinear CZM reproduces the macroscopic
                 mechanical response and the failure process while the
                 exponential form fails to do so. From the numerical
                 simulations, the parameters that describe the bilinear
                 CZM are determined. The sensitivity of the various
                 cohesive zone parameters in predicting the overall
                 interfacial mechanical response (as observed in the
                 thin-slice push out test) is carefully examined. Many
                 researchers have suggested that two independent
                 parameters (the cohesive energy, and either of the
                 cohesive strength or the separation displacement) are
                 sufficient to model cohesive zones implying that the
                 form (shape) of the traction--separation equations is
                 unimportant. However, it is shown in this work that in
                 addition to the two independent parameters, the form of
                 the traction--separation equations for CZMs plays a
                 very critical role in determining the macroscopic

                 by Miehe. However, our results in this study for
                 heterogeneous materials have shown that the choice of
                 regularization length not only affects the macroscopic
                 mechanical behavior but also the local crack
                 propagation patterns. As a result, it can be
                 challenging to select an appropriate value that
                 produces both accurate macroscopic responses and local
                 crack patterns for certain phase-field models, such as
                 Miehe's model. Thus, the phase-field model proposed by
                 Wu, which has been proven to reduce the length
                 sensitivity for homogeneous material, has been
                 successfully implemented in an FFT-based solver with
                 the application of Newton--Krylov algorithm. The length
                 sensitivity of Wu's phase-field model for heterogeneous
                 materials is also investigated in this paper. Our tests
                 show that Wu's phase-field model has partial length
                 sensitivity for heterogeneous materials. However, the
                 main reason for this sensitivity is that one phase
                 enters the damage zone of other phase, which is
                 different from Miehe's model. As a result, a set of
                 criteria for accurately choosing the regularization
                 value has been established for Wu's model in this work.
                 Meanwhile, it has also been found that Wu's model may
                 be more suitable than Miehe's model for brittle failure
                 due to the introduction of an elastic stage.},

                 suitable variational structure, has opened a path for
                 using Griffith's energy balance to predict the fracture
                 of solids. These so-called phase field fracture methods
                 have gained significant popularity over the past
                 decade, and are now part of commercial finite element
                 packages and engineering fitness- for-service
                 assessments. Crack paths can be predicted, in arbitrary
                 geometries and dimensions, based on a global energy
                 minimization-without the need for ad hoc criteria. In
                 this work, we review the fundamentals of phase field
                 fracture methods and examine their capabilities in
                 delivering predictions in agreement with the classical
                 fracture mechanics theory pioneered by Griffith. The
                 two most widely used phase field fracture models are
                 implemented in the context of the finite element
                 method, and several paradigmatic boundary value
                 problems are addressed to gain insight into their
                 predictive abilities across all cracking stages; both
                 the initiation of growth and stable crack propagation
                 are investigated. In addition, we examine the
                 effectiveness of phase field models with an internal
                 material length scale in capturing size effects and the
                 transition flaw size concept. Our results show that
                 phase field fracture methods satisfactorily approximate
                 classical fracture mechanics predictions and can also
                 reconcile stress and toughness criteria for fracture.
                 The accuracy of the approximation is however dependent
                 on modelling and constitutive choices; we provide a
                 rationale for these differences and identify suitable
                 approaches for delivering phase field fracture

	abstract = {Abstract The computational modeling of failure
                 mechanisms in solids due to fracture based on sharp
                 crack discontinuities suffers in situations with
                 complex crack topologies. This can be overcome by a
                 diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a
                 crack phase-field. In this paper, we outline a
                 thermodynamically consistent framework for phase-field
                 models of crack propagation in elastic solids, develop
                 incremental variational principles and consider their
                 numerical implementations by multi-field finite element
                 methods. We start our investigation with an intuitive
                 and descriptive derivation of a regularized crack
                 surface functional that $\Gamma$-converges for
                 vanishing length-scale parameter to a sharp crack
                 topology functional. This functional provides the basis
                 for the definition of suitable convex dissipation
                 functions that govern the evolution of the crack
                 phase-field. Here, we propose alternative
                 rate-independent and viscous over-force models that
                 ensure the local growth of the phase-field. Next, we
                 define an energy storage function whose positive
                 tensile part degrades with increasing phase-field. With
                 these constitutive functionals at hand, we derive the
                 coupled balances of quasi-static stress equilibrium and
                 gradient-type phase-field evolution in the solid from
                 the argument of virtual power. Here, we consider a
                 canonical two-field setting for rate-independent
                 response and a time-regularized three-field formulation
                 with viscous over-force response. It is then shown that
                 these balances follow as the Euler equations of
                 incremental variational principles that govern the
                 multi-field problems. These principles make the
                 proposed formulation extremely compact and provide a
                 perfect base for the finite element implementation,
                 including features such as the symmetry of the
                 monolithic tangent matrices. We demonstrate the
                 performance of the proposed phase-field formulations of
                 fracture by means of representative numerical examples.

                 surfaces to properly transmit tractions under
                 frictionless contact conditions. The model is derived
                 from an energy minimization standpoint, and the
                 governing equations are presented in a general
                 Allen--Cahn form, unifying both brittle and cohesive
                 fracture models. A novel elastic energy split is
                 proposed to enforce frictionless contact conditions
                 along the regularized crack set. A fixed-point
                 iterative algorithm is used to solve the system of
                 equations, and an active-set strategy is incorporated
                 to enforce the crack set irreversibility. The model is
                 then applied to study the mechanical-fracture coupling
                 in the fracture of thin films and soil desiccation
                 problems in which intricate crack networks form. We
                 present results for one-dimensional, two-dimensional,
                 and fully three-dimensional configurations, and examine
                 the relationship between the generalized driving
                 energies for fracture and the resulting fracture
                 patterns. We also investigate the impact of stochastic
                 spatial variations in material parameters on fragment
                 statistics and fracture network morphology. To this
                 end, we develop a random field model for fracture

                 The versatility offered by the probabilistic framework
                 is finally highlighted by considering a statistical
                 inverse problem based on physical experiments. It is
                 shown, in particular, that the formulation allows key

                 and curved crack growth) common in materials with
                 strongly anisotropic surface energy via the

	abstract = {The variational phase-field method is an attractive
                 non-local approach of modeling fracture in
                 heterogeneous materials. However, these materials
                 usually require a fine mesh to resolve the fracture
                 process zone. Consequently, the standard finite element
                 solver becomes cumbersome due to the large number of
                 elements in applications with highly heterogeneous
                 materials. Motivated by this limitation, an algorithm
                 based on FFT methods has been introduced in this paper
                 to solve the phase-field model of brittle fracture.
                 Relying on a staggered update scheme, the proposed
                 algorithm solves the fracture problem and mechanical
                 problem separately, both using the FFT technique. It
                 inherits the advantages of classical FFT methods in
                 terms of simplicity of mesh generation and parallel
                 implementation. Introduced within a FFT-based code

                 coalescence. Finally, a model of an idealized
                 continuous fiber composite with void involving over 32

	abstract = {Numerical simulations of brittle fracture using
                 phase-field approaches often employ a discrete
                 approximation framework that applies the same order of
                 interpolation for the displacement and phase-field
                 variables. In particular, the use of linear finite
                 elements to discretize both stress equilibrium and
                 phase-field equations is widespread in the literature.
                 However, the use of P1 Lagrange shape functions to
                 model the phase-field is not optimal, as the latter
                 contains cusps for fully developed cracks. These should
                 in turn occur at locations corresponding to Gauss
                 points of the associated FE model for the mechanics.
                 Such a feature is challenging to reproduce accurately
                 with low order elements, and element sizes must
                 consequently be made very small relative to the
                 phase-field regularization parameter in order to
                 achieve convergence of results with respect to the
                 mesh. In this paper, we combine a standard linear FE
                 discretization of stress equilibrium with a
                 cell-centered finite volume approximation of the
                 phase-field evolution equation based on the two-point
                 flux approximation constructed over the same simplex
                 mesh. Compared to a pure FE formulation utilizing
                 linear elements, the proposed framework results in
                 looser restrictions on mesh refinement with respect to

                 bonded to polyimide directly or via a 10 nm chromium

                 electronics. This work reviews the recent development

                 combination of metallic thin films revealing a giant
                 magnetoresistance effect with elastomeric materials.
                 Stretchability of the magnetic nanomembranes is
                 achieved by specific morphologic features (e.g.
                 wrinkles or microcracks), which accommodate the applied
                 tensile deformation while maintaining the electrical
                 and magnetic integrity of the sensor device. The entire
                 development, from the demonstration of the world's
                 first elastically stretchable magnetic sensor to the
                 realization of a technology platform for robust,
                 ready-to-use elastic magnetosensorics is described.
                 Soft giant magnetoresistive elements exhibiting the
                 same sensing performance as on conventional rigid
                 supports, but with fully strain invariant properties up

                 flexible electronics is the fragmentation test or

                 When performed in situ, fracture and deformation
                 behavior can be determined. The use of in situ

                 synchrotron X-ray diffraction under uniaxial tensile

                 behavior can be well reflected in the stress-strain
                 curves determined by synchrotron X-ray diffraction.
                 Generally, the yield strength decreases while the
                 cracking strain increases with increasing grain size,
                 due to the constraint effect of grain size on
                 dislocation activity. Different from the yield
                 strength, the fracture strength is almost unchanged
                 with grain size. The fracture toughness is found to
                 increase as the grain size increases, which is
                 attributed to the enhanced plasticity during fracture
                 process. Additionally, the interfacial adhesion energy

                 uniaxial) and the strain path (equibiaxial or sequenced
                 uniaxial) on the cracking of metallic thin films is
                 studied. We used 20, 100 and 600 nm Nickel films
                 deposited onto flexible substrates, analysed with
                 in-situ X-ray diffraction and digital image
                 correlation, and post-mortem optical microscopy. It is
                 shown that the thickness and the loading ratio effects
                 are interweaved. In particular, 600 nm films show a
                 small (1.9\%) von Mises fracture strain and straight
                 cracks when strained equibiaxially, but a larger
                 (2.7\%) fracture strain and more tortuous cracks when
                 strained uniaxially. On the contrary, 20 and 100 nm
                 thin films show different von Mises ultimate tensile
                 strengths, though their von Mises fracture strain and
                 theirs cracks tortuosity hardly depend on the test.},

	abstract = {Surface instabilities including wrinkles and
                 buckle-delaminations are widespread in nature and can
                 be found in a wide range of practical applications.
                 Compared with the homogeneous wrinkle mode, the
                 buckle-delaminations are spontaneously
                 stress-localized, and their initiation positions and
                 geometrical parameters are hardly precisely controlled
                 by a simple method. Here, we report on the controllable
                 buckle-delaminations in periodic thickness-gradient
                 metal films on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates
                 by uniaxial mechanical compression. It is found that a
                 periodic thickness-gradient film is spontaneously
                 formed by masking a copper grid during deposition. The
                 released mechanical strain tends to concentrate in
                 thinner film regions, resulting in the restricted
                 growth of buckle-delaminations. The geometrical
                 features, evolutional behaviors, and underlying
                 physical mechanisms of such buckle-delaminations are
                 analyzed and discussed in detail based on the buckling
                 model and finite element simulations. This work would
                 provide a better understanding of the restricted
                 buckle-delaminations in heterogeneous film-substrate
                 systems and controllable fabrication of ordered
                 structural arrays by copper grid masking and mechanical
                 loading.},

@article{Arbib2020,
	abstract = {We explore the nonlinear variational modeling of
                 two-dimensional (2D) crystal plasticity based on strain
                 energies which are invariant under the full symmetry
                 group of 2D lattices. We use a natural parameterization
                 of strain space via the upper complex Poincar{\'e}
                 half-plane. This transparently displays the constraints
                 imposed by lattice symmetry on the energy landscape.
                 Quasi-static energy minimization naturally induces
                 bursty plastic flow and shape change in the crystal due
                 to the underlying coordinated basin-hopping local
                 strain activity. This is mediated by the nucleation,
                 interaction, and annihilation of lattice defects
                 occurring with no need for auxiliary hypotheses.
                 Numerical simulations highlight the marked effect of
                 symmetry on all these processes. The kinematical atlas
                 induced by symmetry on strain space elucidates how the
                 arrangement of the energy extremals and the possible
                 bifurcations of the strain-jump paths affect the
                 plastification mechanisms and defect-pattern complexity

                 atomistic simulations. This expression is used to
                 analyze the deformation fields for a one-dimensional
                 atomic chain, a biaxially stretched thin film
                 containing a surface ledge, and a FCC metal subject to
                 indentation loading from a nanometer-scale indenter.
                 The analyses presented show that the metric established
                 here is consistent with the continuum mechanical
                 concept of deformation gradient (which is known to have
                 a zero curl for compatible deformations) in most
                 instances. However, our metric does yield non-zero
                 values of curl for atoms near loaded geometric
                 inhomogeneities, such as those that form the ledges
                 themselves and those beneath or adjacent to the
                 indentation contact region. Also, we present
                 expressions for higher order gradients of the
                 deformation field and discuss the requirements for
                 their calculation. These expressions are necessary for
                 linking atomistic simulation results with advanced
                 continuum mechanics theories such as strain gradient
                 plasticity, thereby enabling fundamental, atomic-scale
                 information to contribute to the formulation and

	abstract = {A transition from a square to a hexagonal lattice is
                 studied in a 2D system of particles interacting via a
                 core-softened potential. Due to the presence of two
                 length scales of repulsion, different local
                 configurations with four, five, and six neighbors are
                 possible, leading to the formation of complex crystals.
                 The previously proposed interpolation method is
                 generalized to calculate pair correlations in crystals
                 whose unit cell consists of more than one particle. The
                 high efficiency of the method is illustrated using a
                 snub square lattice as a representative example.
                 Molecular dynamics simulations show that the snub
                 square lattice is broken upon heating, generating a
                 high-density quasicrystalline phase with 12-fold
                 symmetry (HD12 phase). A simple theoretical model is
                 proposed to explain the physical mechanism responsible
                 for this phenomenon: with an increase in the density
                 (from square to hexagonal phases), the concentrations
                 of different local configurations randomly realized
                 through a plane tiling change, which minimizes the
                 energy of the system. The calculated phase diagram in
                 the intermediate density range justifies the existence
                 of the HD12 phase and demonstrates a cascade of
                 first-order transitions ``square - HD12 - hexagonal''
                 solid phases with increasing density. The results allow
                 us to better understand the physical mechanisms
                 responsible for the formation of quasicrystals, and,
                 therefore, should be of interest for broad community in
                 materials science and soft matter.},

                 solid-solid phase transition. Models contain 6400

                 73, 011406 (2006)). This phase transition occurs in a
                 martensitic manner which involves local diffusionless
                 motion of the atoms and orientation between the parent
                 and product lattices is special of 45$\,^{\circ}$. The
                 new phase is a polycrystalline 2D crystal with a
                 triangle lattice structure. Via decompression of the
                 obtained 2D crystal with a triangle lattice structure

                 the shape memory effect. Temperature dependence of the

                 new phase at the critical density presents a clear

@article{Gao2020a,
	abstract = {Deformation and structural phase transitions are
                 typical physical processes, which can produce variety
                 types of defects (e.g., twinning and dislocation) in
                 metals and alloys. Those crystalline defects are
                 critical in determining the mechanical and functional
                 properties of materials. Theoretically, crystalline
                 defects belong to the so-called topological defects,
                 which are generated by symmetry breaking processes. In
                 spite of the well-established group theory description
                 of crystal symmetry (for an individual crystal), a
                 theoretical framework to characterize multiple symmetry
                 breaking processes (e.g., multiple transformation
                 pathways between two crystals, multiple deformation
                 twinning modes) is still lacking. In the literature, a
                 graph method, phase transition graph, has been
                 introduced to describe the pathway connectivity in
                 specific martensitic transformations. However, a
                 general framework capturing the coupling of deformation
                 and phase transitions is unavailable, partially due to
                 the lack of rigorous connection between group theory
                 (description of crystal symmetry) and graph theory
                 (description of deformation pathway connectivity). In
                 this paper, a theoretical connection between crystal
                 symmetry and pathway connectivity is rigorously
                 established for the first time. By examining the broken
                 and preserved symmetries during crystal deformation and
                 structural phase transitions through group theory, we
                 employ a Cayley graph method to analyze symmetry
                 groups, which leads to a new theoretical description of
                 symmetry breaking based on group theory and graph
                 theory. Our graph approach establishes a mathematical
                 foundation to investigate the symmetry breaking
                 associated with deformation and structural phase
                 transitions in crystals, which also provides a new
                 insight into the physical origin of crystalline
                 defects.},

	abstract = {Deformation twinning in crystals is one of the major
                 strain carrier during plastic deformation, which plays
                 a critical role in determining the mechanical
                 properties of metals and alloys. One of the key issues
                 to understand deformation twinning mechanisms is the
                 determination of deformation path, which is critical
                 for the calculations of twinning strain and critical
                 shear stress. This work provides a new perspective on
                 deformation twinning by systematically investigating
                 the relationship between symmetry breaking and
                 deformation path, with the purpose of establishing a
                 theoretical foundation to identify the broken
                 symmetries associated with twinning and predicting the
                 twinning modes using group theory and graph theory.
                 From a physical point of view, deformation twins can be
                 regarded as one type of the so-called topological
                 defects that are induced by symmetry-breaking. Taking
                 BCC crystals as an example, we demonstrate how the
                 presence of intermediate high symmetry states in the
                 deformation strain space (strain calculated through
                 lattice distortion) along the twinning path, such as
                 FCC, HCP or orthorhombic state, can lead to different
                 characteristic twinning modes. Our predictions not only
                 agree well with classical theoretical analyses and
                 experimental observations in BCC metals and alloys, but
                 also reveal the origin of recently observed high-index
                 twinning modes (such as \{5 8 11\} and \{3 9 10\}
                 twins). This work may open a new avenue for analyzing
                 deformation twinning through the symmetry breaking
                 along twinning pathways.},

	abstract = {Even though martensitic transformations (MTs) in shape
                 memory alloys (SMAs) are thermoelastic (i.e., fully
                 reversible) and the polydomain structures of martensite
                 are self-accommodating with invariant-plane strains,
                 dislocations and sometimes grain boundaries seems to be
                 the inevitable byproducts of the transformation during
                 either thermal or stress cycling, similar to what have
                 been observed during MTs in non-SMAs such as steels.
                 These characteristics associated with MT cycling can
                 lead to some serious problems such as dimensional
                 instability and functional fatigue. In this review, we
                 introduce a recently developed theoretical construct
                 called phase transformation graph (PTG) analysis and
                 show that defect generation in SMAs and their
                 functionality and performance are closely related to
                 the topology of their PTGs. Using PTG topology as a
                 guide, we discuss design strategies to alter the
                 topology of PTGs for high-performance SMAs with
                 improved functionality and functional fatigue
                 resistance. Most of our predictions have been confirmed
                 by experimental characterization and testing. The PTG
                 analysis could open a new avenue for judicious design
                 of next-generation SMAs for widespread technological
                 applications.},

	abstract = {We analyze the behavior of different elastoplastic
                 models approaching the yielding transition. We propose
                 two kinds of rules for the local yielding events:
                 yielding occurs above the local threshold either at a
                 constant rate or with a rate that increases as the
                 square root of the stress excess. We establish a family
                 of ``static'' universal critical exponents which do not
                 depend on this dynamic detail of the model rules: in
                 particular, the exponents for the avalanche size
                 distribution P(S) ∼S-$\tau$Sf(S/Ldf) and the
                 exponents describing the density of sites at the verge
                 of yielding, which we find to be of the form P(x)
                 ≃P(0) + x$\vartheta$ with P(0) ∼L-a controlling the
                 extremal statistics. On the other hand, we discuss
                 ``dynamical'' exponents that are sensitive to the local
                 yielding rule. We find that, apart form the dynamical
                 exponent z controlling the duration of avalanches, also
                 the flowcurve's (inverse) Herschel-Bulkley exponent
                 $\beta$ ([small gamma, Greek, dot above]∼
                 ($\sigma$-$\sigma$c)$\beta$) enters in this category,
                 and is seen to differ in ½ between the two yielding
                 rate cases. We give analytical support to this
                 numerical observation by calculating the exponent
                 variation in the H{\'e}braud-Lequeux model and finding
                 an identical shift. We further discuss an alternative
                 mean-field approximation to yielding only based on the
                 so-called Hurst exponent of the accumulated mechanical
                 noise signal, which gives good predictions for the
                 exponents extracted from simulations of fully spatial
                 models.},

                 constitutes a long-standing challenge for dislocation

                 orders of magnitude in dissipated energy or stress
                 drop. Scaling exponents are determined using
                 finite-size scaling for systems with 10(3)-10(6)
                 particles. Three distinct universality classes are
                 identified corresponding to overdamped and underdamped
                 limits, as well as a crossover damping that separates
                 the two regimes. For each universality class, the
                 exponent describing the avalanche distributions is the
                 same in two and three dimensions. The spatial extent of
                 plastic deformation is proportional to the energy
                 dissipated in an avalanche. Both rise much more rapidly
                 with system size in the underdamped limit where inertia
                 is important. Inertia also lowers the mean energy of
                 configurations sampled by the system and leads to an
                 excess of large events like that seen in earthquake

                 systems the stress variation scales inversely with the
                 square root of the system size. For underdamped systems
                 the variation is determined by the size of the largest

                 details of the mechanism by which dislocations
                 homogeneously nucleate beneath the surface of a
                 initially defect-free crystal during indentation. The
                 mechanism involves the collective motion of a finite
                 disk of atoms over two adjacent slip planes, the
                 diameter of which depends on the indenter size. The
                 nucleation mechanism highlights the need for nonlocal
                 considerations in the development of a nucleation
                 criterion. We review three nucleation criteria from the
                 literature, each of which is based on purely local
                 measures of the state of stress, and show that none are
                 sufficiently general to predict nucleation in realistic
                 atomic systems. We then propose a criterion based on an
                 eigenmode analysis of the atomic-scale acoustic tensor.
                 We demonstrate the accuracy of the criterion, which
                 also works in the presence of existing topological
                 defects like free surfaces or dislocation cores. The
                 dependence of the size of the nucleated disk on the
                 indenter radius leads to a self-similar nucleation
                 process and virtually no indentation size effect (ISE),

                 allowing for independent mass motion and lattice

                 equilibrium on the timescale of plastic motion. We show

                 mechanical stability of engineering and geophysical
                 structures. For these applications, an accurate
                 knowledge of the processes at the origin of shear
                 localization, i.e. faulting, in frictional granular
                 assemblies submitted to compressive loading is needed.
                 Here we tackle this problem by performing
                 discrete-element numerical simulations. A thorough
                 analysis of the evolution of multi-scale mechanical
                 properties as approaching sample macroscopic
                 instability is performed. Spatial correlations
                 operating within the shear stress and strain fields are
                 analyzed by means of a coarse-graining analysis. The

                 shear stress and strain fields as approaching the
                 transition to sample instability. We thus show that the
                 crossover from a quasi-static regime where the sample
                 deforms infinitely slowly to a dense flow regime, where
                 inertial forces play a significant role, can be
                 interpreted as a critical phase transition. At this
                 transition, no shear band of characteristic thickness
                 can be defined.},

                 interatomic potentials of the Lennard-Jones type,
                 LJ12-6 and LJ9-6, are simulated. The athermal
                 quasistatic shearing protocol is adopted, where the
                 shear strain is applied in a stepwise fashion with each
                 step followed by energy minimization. For each
                 avalanche event, the shear stress drop
                 ($\Delta$$\sigma$), the hydrostatic pressure drop
                 ($\Delta$$\sigma$\_\{h\}), and the potential energy
                 drop ($\Delta$E) are computed. It is found that, with
                 the avalanche size increasing, the three become
                 proportional to each other asymptotically. The
                 probability distributions of avalanche sizes are
                 obtained and values of scaling exponents fitted. In
                 particular, the distributions follow a power law,
                 P($\Delta$U)∼$\Delta$U^\{-$\tau$\}, where $\Delta$U
                 is a measure of avalanche sizes defined based on shear
                 stress drops. The exponent $\tau$ is 1.25$\pm$0.1 for

                 develop a predictive modeling that incorporates
                 dislocation-based plastic activity and microstructural
                 evolution. Phase-field method has emerged as a powerful
                 tool for addressing this issue, providing us with a
                 versatile variational framework able to describe the
                 movement of dislocations in interaction with underlying
                 microstructures. In this article, a three-dimensional
                 phase-field model of dislocations (PFMD) is developed
                 with a discretization scheme that explicitly captures
                 the face-centered cubic (FCC) geometry. Within this
                 framework, continuous fields are discretized in a way
                 that allows to consider strongly heterogeneous
                 materials and sharp interfaces (free surfaces, stiffer
                 precipitates, pores...) without generating numerical
                 artifacts. The PFMD exposed in this work reproduces
                 dislocation activity in FCC geometry, their reactions,
                 and a particular attention is devoted to the
                 dislocation core behaviors in order to remove effects
                 present in prior generic PFMDs that can appear to be
                 spurious for micron-scale applications. This allows us
                 to rigorously reproduce the dislocation's velocity with
                 respect to experimental friction coefficients. The

                 for our understanding of natural and man-made
                 phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and
                 characterization of power laws is complicated by the
                 large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the
                 distribution---the part of the distribution
                 representing large but rare events---and by the
                 difficulty of identifying the range over which
                 power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for
                 analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares
                 fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates
                 of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in
                 cases where such methods return accurate answers they
                 are still unsatisfactory because they give no
                 indication of whether the data obey a power law at all.
                 Here we present a principled statistical framework for
                 discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in
                 empirical data. Our approach combines

                 which in turn, is controlled by an engineering process.
                 Strengthening mechanisms like work hardening,
                 precipitate, and grain boundary strengthening can alter
                 the strength of a material in a predictive,
                 quantitative manner and are readily linked to the
                 deformation mechanism. This quantification strongly
                 depends on the characteristic length scale of a
                 particular microstructure, thereby dictating bulk
                 material's strength as a function of, for example,
                 grain or precipitate size, twin boundary spacing, or
                 dislocation density. This microstructural, or
                 intrinsic, size governs the mechanical properties and
                 post-elastic material deformation at all sample
                 dimensions, as the classical definition of ``ultimate
                 tensile strength'' deems it to be ``an intensive
                 property, therefore its value does not depend on the
                 size of the test specimen.'' Yet in the last 5years,
                 the vast majority of uniaxial deformation experiments
                 and computations on small-scale metallic structures
                 unambiguously demonstrated that at the micron and
                 sub-micron scales, this definition no longer holds
                 true. In fact, it has been shown that in single
                 crystals the ultimate tensile strength and the yield
                 strength scale with external sample size in a power law
                 fashion, sometimes attaining a significant fraction of
                 material's theoretical strength, and exhibiting the
                 now-commonly-known phenomenon ``smaller is stronger.''
                 Understanding of this ``extrinsic size effect'' at
                 small scales is not yet mature and is currently a topic
                 of rigorous investigations. As both the intrinsic (i.e.
                 microstructural) and extrinsic (i.e. sample size)
                 dimensions play a non-trivial role in the mechanical
                 properties and material deformation mechanisms, it is
                 critical to develop an understanding of their interplay
                 and mutual effects on the mechanical properties and
                 material deformation, especially in small-scale
                 structures. This review focuses on providing an
                 overview of metal-based material classes whose
                 properties as a function of external size have been
                 investigated and provides a critical discussion on the

                 the material deformation behavior.},

                 negligible and in which flow inhomogeneities such as
                 shear bands or fractures are absent. Here we propose a
                 scaling description of the yielding transition in
                 amorphous solids made of soft particles at zero
                 temperature. Our description makes a connection between
                 the Herschel-Bulkley exponent characterizing the
                 singularity of the flow curve near the yield stress
                 $\Sigma$c, the extension and duration of the avalanches
                 of plasticity observed at threshold, and the density
                 P(x) of soft spots, or shear transformation zones, as a
                 function of the stress increment x beyond which they
                 yield. We argue that the critical exponents of the
                 yielding transition may be expressed in terms of three
                 independent exponents, $\vartheta$, df, and z,
                 characterizing, respectively, the density of soft
                 spots, the fractal dimension of the avalanches, and
                 their duration. Our description shares some similarity
                 with the depinning transition that occurs when an
                 elastic manifold is driven through a random potential,
                 but also presents some striking differences. We test
                 our arguments in an elasto-plastic model, an automaton
                 model similar to those used in depinning, but with a
                 different interaction kernel, and find satisfying
                 agreement with our predictions in both two and three
                 dimensions.},

                 Roelcke?Selberg decomposition. This decomposition
                 characterizes the function in terms of a set of

                 possibility of tracking the approach to final failure
                 in terms either of discrete events (the avalanches) or
                 of the resulting continuous strain field. Different but
                 actually closely linked phenomena are reported. In
                 terms of damage avalanches, power law distributions of
                 avalanche sizes and energies are observed associated
                 with a finite size scaling. The finite size scaling is
                 also observed for the spatial correlations of damage
                 events. A divergence of the correlation length is
                 reported in the vicinity of final failure, from a
                 correlation analysis of discrete events and from a
                 scaling analysis of the continuous strain rate field.
                 We also show that multifractal properties of the

                 furnish a fundamental background to the understanding
                 of plastic flow across sample sizes. It is shown that
                 self-organized criticality (SOC) governs the size
                 distribution of dislocation avalanches in
                 micrometer-sized sample dimensions. Onset of SOC
                 denotes inception of a dislocation network so that
                 dislocation avalanches occur at constant criticality
                 level irrespectively of the applied stress. In these
                 microcrystals, we find that the ratio between the
                 characteristic sample dimension and the mean free path
                 traveled by the mobile dislocations, D/Leff, rules the
                 onset of strain hardening. This index simultaneously
                 accounts for the role of loading orientation and
                 dislocation density upon microscale plasticity. It is
                 shown that strain-hardening emerges for D/Leff>2, where
                 surface dislocation annihilations are inconsequential
                 to network development and the flow stress scales with
                 dislocation density. This regime naturally evolves
                 toward bulk plasticity at increasing sample sizes.
                 Conversely, strain hardening is suppressed when
                 confining sample dimensions dominate plastic flow for
                 D/Leff<1.5. Confining microscale plasticity is

                 in a discontinuous brittle way, as metallic and
                 molecular glasses do. Yielding corresponds in this case
                 to a first-order nonequilibrium phase transition. As
                 the degree of annealing decreases, the first-order

                 emphasis on a vector density representation of
                 dislocations. A companion thermodynamic analysis
                 yielded a generalized expression for the driving force
                 of dislocations that depend on Mandel (Cauchy) stress
                 in the reference (spatial) configurations and the
                 contribution of the dislocation core energy to the free
                 energy of the crystal. Our formulation relied on
                 several dislocation density tensor measures linked to
                 the incompatibility of the plastic distortion in the
                 crystal. While previous works develop such tensors
                 starting from the multiplicative decomposition of the
                 deformation gradient, we developed the tensor measures
                 of the dislocation density and the dislocation flux
                 from the additive decomposition of the displacement
                 gradient and the crystal velocity fields. The two-point
                 dislocation density measures defined by the referential
                 curl of the plastic distortion and the spatial curl of
                 the inverse elastic distortion and the associate

                 quenched random field (RFIM), which has applications in
                 many areas from materials to social science. By working
                 at zero temperature in the quasistatically driven RFIM,
                 thermal fluctuations are eliminated and one can give a
                 rigorous content to the notion of spinodal. We show
                 that the latter is due to the depinning and the
                 subsequent expansion of rare droplets. We work out the
                 associated critical behavior, which, in any finite
                 dimension, is very different from the mean-field one:
                 the characteristic length diverges exponentially and
                 the thermodynamic quantities display very mild
                 nonanalyticities much like in a Griffith phenomenon.

                 materials under constant stress involves the motion of
                 a large number of interacting dislocations. Analytical
                 methods and sophisticated 'dislocation dynamics'
                 simulations have proved very effective in the study of
                 dislocation patterning, and have led to macroscopic
                 constitutive laws of plastic deformation. Yet, a
                 statistical analysis of the dynamics of an assembly of
                 interacting dislocations has not hitherto been
                 performed. Here we report acoustic emission
                 measurements on stressed ice single crystals, the
                 results of which indicate that dislocations move in a
                 scale-free intermittent fashion. This result is
                 confirmed by numerical simulations of a model of
                 interacting dislocations that successfully reproduces
                 the main features of the experiment. We find that
                 dislocations generate a slowly evolving configuration
                 landscape which coexists with rapid collective
                 rearrangements. These rearrangements involve a
                 comparatively small fraction of the dislocations and
                 lead to an intermittent behaviour of the net plastic

                 generic feature in the deformation of many other

                 quasicontinuum method links atomistic and continuum
                 models through the device of the finite element method
                 which permits a reduction of the full set of atomistic
                 degrees of freedom. The present paper gives a full
                 description of the quasicontinuum method, with special
                 reference to the ways in which the method may be used
                 to model crystals with more than a single grain. The
                 formulation is validated in terms of a series of
                 calculations on grain boundary structure and
                 energetics. The method is then illustrated in terms of
                 the motion of a stepped twin boundary where a critical
                 stress for the boundary motion is calculated and
                 nanoindentation into a solid containing a subsurface
                 grain boundary to study the interaction of dislocations
                 with grain boundaries.},

                 are known to characterize steady state plastic flow in
                 crystalline materials. In this Letter we study the
                 emergence of correlations in a simple
                 Frenkel-Kontorova-type model of 2D plasticity which is
                 largely free of arbitrariness, amenable to analytical
                 study, and is capable of generating critical exponents
                 matching experiments. Our main observation concerns the
                 possibility to reduce continuum plasticity to an
                 integer-valued automaton revealing inherent
                 discreteness of the plastic flow.},
